"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.

A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.

Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.

Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money.

In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesn't have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.

In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.",human
"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.      ",human
"Agree you will never grow if something beyond of what you have mastered. However, some people believe that you don't have to do this to grow that you can grow conform the time. Emerson's was right with this quote people have think more then just of what they believe, if they grow they will achieve their dreams if they achieve they will grow you just have to believe in what you are.

Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences I'm growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we don't an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow,no matter what is happening he we have to grow.

At the end of all of this we will have something do where we can be support our live, always come something better, you have to be organize with your things. The idea is to be your self don't ever let other people to control you just be you, and the decision is on you.

Don't you ever be an a position to where you have to decide between to options? That's when you to believe in yourself, to thing want your want to be grow or stay in the floor. If you grow will be more opportunities for you and maybe don't just for you can be for the others who are around of you.

Give the best of you to make it, for example if you don't try to grow what will be of you what kind of person you will be.

There are benefits to grow like you can be a person who can do almost all the things ,you can be accept or be sociable. Emerson gave us a great point with this statement we have to appreciate of what he wrote in my view he completeright about to try something beyond what you have already, just try and you can make it.",human
"I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. John Lubock mentions that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I think that this quote explains that you are able to choose it by yourself. I disagree and I believe that other humans make our character traits.",human
"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.",human
"Dear Winston Churchill,

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

"CAN WE ACCOMPLISH BY ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING

Can people accomplish by always doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always not doing something productive? No, being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing. Although, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. People would learn more things, meet new people to achieve goals in life and how much can be done if we are always doing something.

People would learn more things if they are more productive. I remember when my mom signed me up for a soccer team. I didn't know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed. Another example was when I had a vocabulary test for English but I didnt know half of the vocabulary words, so I study till I learned the words.

Meeting new people to achieve a goals. I like being a indoor person, but when soccer season comes and I join a team I interact with new people and coaches to achieve my goals on how to become a better teammate or how I can improve my speed and mentality to become a great soccer player. Another example was when I talked to a new math teacher to help me on a equation I didnt understand. he helped me understand the equation, and helps me every time I need help on something in math now.

Imagine how much can be done if we are always doing something. people would be able to accomplish so many goals if we are always doing something instead of staying home and laying down and watch TV all day. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better. Maybe when we think we dont need help, but actually do ask someone to help you to understand more instead of staying with the same mindset.

Although, some people maybe don't got that much time to accomplish things. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time. Inactivity also can also serve a purpose, depending on the person maybe they dont got money or a transportation vehicle to get to their destination. Although, they can't just do nothing and wait for something good to happen to them.

People can accomplish their goals by always doing something that would helped them in the future. Thomas Jefferson wrote,''Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" People would learn more things, meeting new people to achieve a goal and how much can be done if we are always doing something productive.

Writing SOL

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.   ",human
"When people ask for advise, they usually don't know what path or choice to make.

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

Also if you do they can take your stuff, steal money, stab you in the back and also become an turn on you, a freind is a doller in your pocket and your pocket gots a hole my mom says that to me a lot. Just do what your heart says not other people because the can get you in a lot of trouble.

This is what can go good for you, if you make the right choice you can go to college and get a degree in something you like. You can get a good job and get a good house, good car and always have money on you just in case of anything. You also can help out your perents get a good house and you won't have to put them in a home and you can also bye what your kids want when ever they wan't and you won't have to go through the bad stuff in the world like most people go through to put food on the table.",human
"Each people in the world should have any to trip in life because each failure,wrong, and bad day our help a better each aspect in the life as social, personal and work, and this consist in learn for each failure and no come back to fall in the same not is advancing nothing in his life.

my mother is the best woman in the world because she never had help of my father or other people for care me to me and my brother and with a lot effort she to achieve give them a life very good and ours show that in the life a bad moments as good people but always is united as family and help of god can out of this failures for achieve in the life ""sucess"" that each people to deserve .

For example, in this world there a lot people that are very succesful in his life is because they each pursuit his happiness, every day they wake up with a great spirits from follow to from in his life to achieve his dreams, goals and the sucess. Also can be that others days they have a bad day but always follow fighting an against always the people has that is firm in a only target that is "" Pursuit of success"". Also all the people that has sucess in the life always are very humble and respectful with it them.

In this world there always there problems for any things, but with so effort,hope, intelligence because all people has problem or failure in the life but no for this should to leave of fight , because the life to try of follow to follow because all the things has any out .

other examples is, when a student take a test and the first time not pass of test but he don't never give up, because always there a more opportunities and only should to follow study and better for that the second time should be better.

Also i have a example that i'm live in my life each day that is when a people as me,when i going to live a other country very different to mine with his way to live and it more important his language is very hard no can to communicate with them, but the beginning is very hard for any people change of country and is more hard if no know the language, but i don't give up because i know it that i'm very smart and with more effort, faith, and help of my teachers, mom and family little to little better my english and each day i learn of new things in the life because never leave of learn in the life. i disagree not can understand it and not can say nothing.

For this failure plays a role very important in ours life because show as the people has abilities for can do any things and know that all the people has intelligence for can achieve it. The failures in the life to help to better and think about that can help to better and however, i think that each people has a goal in the life and not should to renounce a ours dreams, goals that should of achieve it.

Because in the life each people to choose his destiny in the life but i think that all people has a fault but each people has of power for eliminate it of his life.

In conclusion, all the people should of has any failure for can better and achieve his success and happiness in the life with love, hope, and effort for that nothing in the life is so easy , everybody needs is very focus in the life because until the own family may be can think that you are a dump but can show you that you are ""the best"" and that nobody can stop your success in the life and nobody can to take your dreams and goals of your mind and heart and always each day should of think this is my best day, and wake up with spirits of better and be a great pride for your wife, son and people that believe in you , and with help of this people so important in you life give you spirits for achieve it and they to go with your steps to sucess in the life .",human

And then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour. How would you feel after all of that? Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body. An addition, when students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside. Which is a unfair for students and it's bad for the students safety.

Next, students will not have time to spend with there family members nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do. Neither will teacher have time to spend with there kids, since they have test to grad and paper work. In the same token, students would not be motive to play or have fun because all they would think about is school. Beside, the students will not have a lot of time to sleep.

Furthermore, one day the students will not have the energy to go to school. Similarly, they will become depressed and have a negative mood. And the students might not even want to come to school any more. Which put the students in a high risk.

"Self-esteem doesn't come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts we've done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem.

Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention.

Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldn't do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has.

First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't.

In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completetly wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy to do.

The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself.

Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every human've had self-esteem issues at least once and that's alright. I think we shouldn't depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, we've to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, that's where self-esteem comes from.",human

"It has been that fisrt impressions are almost impossible to change on your experiences. I agree with this statament for several reasons. I have many experiences,but some are impossible to change. When I came to this country and when I travel with my sister and my friends to Generic_City and my first day in the School.

First, when I came to this country. This is my first impression impossible to change. When I was in my country I was happy to came to this country to look my parents and sibling. I leave of my country in October 25, 2015. I was in Guatemala for 15 day. I feeling sad, because I don't know who are the other people came in the group. After I was in Mexico for others 10 days. I not eat anything, because I don't liked the food that they gived me, also i was for anothers days in a place called Matamoros is close to the river that with to cross to came to this country. After to cross the river a men of imigration take me to the imigration office and he start to call to my parents to ask about my imformation. I was happy to speak to my parents. My parents pay a ticket to travel to here. I cray of the emotion to see my parents after a few years.

Second, I went to Generic_City with my sister and my friends. This is my second experience tha is impossible to change. I was happy to share time with my friends and my sister in Generic_City. We wented to Time Squared. We take many pictures infront of the tower. After we walked to the red stairs we sit there to look anything and we continued walked to go to the anothers beautiful places that the City has.

Finally, my first impression in my first day in the School. I was happy to go to the School. I feeling sad, because when the teacher start to explain something in English i don't know what she said and I ask to my friends that they speak Spanish they start to explain me what the teacher explain in English. Every day in Schood I learned somenthing different and I feeling happy. Every day when I came to the house after School I speak in English with my lilttle brother than he born here. He teach me English sometimes.

In conclusion, this are my three impressions that impossible to change in my own experiences. I believe that the experiences that we has in the life are only that never past again is only one time.",human
"Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to determine never to be idle. It's one the most important things that happen in the world,One of this was with young people, they be disrespecfull with oldes people. At this point I think everyone be agree with the statement of Thomas Jefferson.

For example, That is one of the problem that happen on many schools cause let's say when teacher tryed to explain us something about the intimate section they star to Idle when this is no funny. Also Thomas Jefferson inspire peopler to help others when they was idle to a inoccent people.

Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other.

It's wonderful if peolpe work as a community and tryed to help other,cause Thomas Jefferson was a men who like to help people on what he can. When someone else was Idle to you don't put attention and keep figthing on what you want .Like everyone know we have different talens and always one person of them was jealousy and tryed to Idle you cause he don't want you or someone else progress more them he that unfair everyone have different dreams and work hard vfor what they want.

On my opinion wse can work as a group and tryed to stop those peolpe who Idle others. Also we can do something else cause lety's said if vsomeone Idle otyhers and we bdon't help these guys the problem continued and repeat cuade anyone work with the kind of problem.

something else was some people don't like to help others. That cause that kind of problem but we as a community we can work on that and tryed to stoped.",human
"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.

First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.

Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.

Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.

I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do.",human
"In my experiences be disagree with this statement because everybody have different personalitie, The person have one day bad, and the persona change.

however the first impressions can be change, Everybody have different personalitie becuase the people make much caracterist tha see different for example a person can have much cualidad that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself.

The person have one day bad becuase something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class , also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.

However the people change becuase they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be esplendi,

for example no every person have bad comportamient.

"School should not extend the school days more than eight hours. Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time. Studing and teaching requieres focus and creativity but when students and teachers get tired all that is missing.",human
"students should graduate in three years instead of four years.

It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able tho help their families.

The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allow to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind.

The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick and the student have a part time job ,but he don't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines and he have to graduate but he is still in his third year of high school so he have one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One years less can brings chances for others.

Some people believe that students should not graduate in three years instead of four years. However, others including me believe that students should be allow to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able to help their families.

"The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.

If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.

Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat.

To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.",human
"Advice. Advice is something you seek, and search you can ask advice on anything it can be advice for you hair, advice for you dog, doctor advice you can partially ask advice on anything. When people are searching for advice they usually ask more than one person, I think thats best, because you can see from different points of views. I think only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new.

Asking multiple people is better than asking one person for advice, because only asking one person may not get you the advice that is best needed. Asking multiple people for advice is something that can help you find a quicker solution. There are many positive sides when asking people for advice, like having different points of views that can give you tons of ideas and information for the advice that you are looking for. When you are gathering all these opinions you can discover new information and the advice you are looking for.

There are many positive sides when asking multiple for people advice. When you ask people for advice it could be a stranger, a family member, a friend. Entire way you are communicating with others and you can make friends while asking the for the advice you are looking for. You can learn new things about you friends, and family members, when you ask them for advice . You can also meet someone new and develop communicating skills.

When you ask for advice its best to ask more than one person. I think that it a good idea to see from different points of views and asking multiple people because, you discover different opinions and ideas. Only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice.

"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble,or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives?

In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them , it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.

For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules .

Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.

Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them.  ",human
"Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.",human
"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose. In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.",human
"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",human
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.",human
"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality.",human
"Whats one place you would love to visit? One place I would like to visit is Ethiopia. I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years. Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members go eat Ethiopian food with them and cherish that moment forever.

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasn't the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. I've lost a lot of people i've cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away.

Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it.

Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go. We can go to the zoo since I never went and I would love to bond with my family members especially if its somewhere I never went before. My family members and I could have a cook out or I can just sleepover a friends house.

In conclusion, I would love to visit Ethiopia because my family and friends are there since i've missed so much while I was in America. I'd love to breathe the fresh air and eat the fresh food my grandma makes. Plus I would love to run around the backyard with my frirends.",human
"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

"Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.",human
"I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school everyday. Lets say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round schools, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc...

First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want.

Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much and they want to spend time with you too.

Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat , go to mall, watch a movie etc...

In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to a amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation. People might think that their family is annoying or they don't love them but your parents and siblings love you because we are not perfect in every way.",human
"Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next.",human
"I undestand the company Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "" Unless you try to so something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Base on your experience, I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow.

Is it important to know if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive and we do not have a lot money to pay it but we insist to invest in that we are not going to get ahead. Another example is, when is almost time to pay bills we have to save money to pay them.

Because he is trying to convice us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo. Thank you for considering my ideas regarding.",human
"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",human
"It is a better choice asking more than one person because when you ask them what's your problem or question most of them are going to say something else while some are just going to say the same thing. But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But don't ask one person cause one that person might not know and two it's not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or it's idea. And you might get your problem or question answered by asking multiple of people. Conclusion that you should ask more than one person so you can get more multiple opinions and you might get the right answer of your problem or question by the right person. But some people don't like telling other people there question or problem one cause there scared or shy or they might think that the person will not know or understand what the person is talking about that sometimes can happened it happen to my friend once where he had a math question asked the teacher but the teacher didn't know what he meant or what he was talking about so the teacher tryed to tell him his question but that wasnt the question my friend ask for so he told a student that sits next to him and he understanded what he was talking about so he then helped him with the question he had.",human
"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.",human
"The negative effects of Technology allows people to complete many tasks like check out books, shop, and play games with out speakings to other person, all that make people to get not soscial communication, vison problems and force the libraries to change.

For example, when they're playing video games, they spend hours playing videos games that makes them forgot about the person next to them. Secondly, Vision ploblems.

"Once author Ralph Waldo Emerson Said ""unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have masterd you will never grow"", and he is right. To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery.

If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learnand teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you can't do one small task doesn't mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow.

"The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.

It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think. A positive attitude describes how much effort people are putting into the problems they are facing. To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through. Some people may say that a positive attitude is not always needed to become successful, however a positive attitude is the key to success in life. To be positive in life is really important, since it helps people to face problems and become successful.               ",human
"Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

"Kindness,you may know it and I might know and everyone might know, but what is kindness? and why does kindness have such a huge impact on others?

First of all, what is kindness? well kindness is when you give back to others like doing big things like donating to charity or something small like holding the door for others, but what really is kindness? those are just simple things we do, but why? why help others? We choose to help others so then they can help others and we can show the world to be better. Kindness is the key to making someone happy or feel like giving back we help others so they can try to give back.

Secondly why does kindness have such a huge impact on others?

Well we all like giving back, some might disagree or agree but we just want the world to be a better place not just for ourselves but for your kids. You just want you and your kids to be nice, because one day they'll look back and be thankful that someone helped them by holding the door or complimented them and just like that they feel something inside them they feel happy just by one thing someone does they can have a HUDGE impact on them.

In conclusion, Kindness has a HUDGE impact on others and what really kindness means to you and me and by just doing the smallest things you can change someone and they can can also change someone because of you!",human
"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",human
"Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.

It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In today's generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.

Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.

In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.

So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. ",human
"Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         ",human
"I disagree , because it's true the firts impression in a personis the most important when knowing a other's.

As humans depends of other's for the survivor;our's characteristics are for genetic of it's way. For this to treat the way of to attach in a group of people.

some people thinking that no it's neccesary because,no we depends of the opinion of he people or the world,for the opponent each person have the different way of interact ,each person have an different way of think,personality,character,and the way of to act. The stereotype's of the society of base in the system of that eachperson of the world is different not all aresame and that each individual have are world,the place were they it felling better and comfortable.

In exchange of other people have an idea different...in a new job,in the university,and place's important's of any place;we obligation of the respectful and amiability. The people have the capacity to be good and refined,the impression of the people duty of be always of the better.

"Being yourself in a world that wants you to be something else is a great feeling but it takes time to be happy for a example,your parents want you to be a doctor or a lawyer but you want to be a rapper or dancer but you don't know how to tell them because you think they would would be disappointed.

would you want to make your parents to feel disappointed,ll give another example people who like the same sex, theirs been so many stories an articles of people dying because their expressing them selves a lot of people are scared so they don't tell anyone so they become depressed they use a lot drugs to lose the pain but nothing ever works.

In my opinion i agree with Ralphh Waldo Emerson it's a amazing feeling to be yourself and not follow other people because at the end of the day you need to be doing things that make you happy not for other,your priories come first be who ever you want to be like and who ever you want you live one life.",human
"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals.

The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant.  ",human
"The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

"In cartoon sponge bob square pants sponge bob he say's "" imagination"" as to us is inferring for us to use our imagination, like no matter how old you are what disabilities you have is inferring to everyone ,But do you ever think imagination is important than knowledge?

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

In conclusion, i agree with this statement "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" because for those given reasons like the one about us as kids we would use our imagination and how we would use it for ourselves and the other given example for the blind people how they have that throughout there life spam. therefore those are my reasons i agree with the given statement.",human
"Would you like someone deciding what's best for you or take matter into your own hands? Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

Deciding what u want probably is what's best since your going at your own paste, your taking it how you want. your going at your own paste with things. Also, no one can stop you from doing what you believe is best for you. You can find your own ways to cope with things without anyone telling you other wise. Going at your own pace is better then getting rushed, doing what you dont want, and doing what your told even. However, getting help pushes you to do it better.

Seeking guidance isnt bad at all either you get the help you need, you get that push forward to bettering yourself. Sometimes in life there are moments where your not your best help and you need a hand. Theres nothing ever wrong with getting a little help. You sometimes need a hand to understand your values to get to recognize them and meet them.

we all have different life matters because we all dont care about the same thing. we all care about different things. your life important matters are valuable and there something that only you can decide on not any one else. Sure, our values all are different in every type of way thats the reason to why we should decide on our own why our life matters are important. thats why in my opinion people should make there own decisions, find out there matters, what there good at and what the things that they value are.",human
"Working Beyond

Do you need to work beyond what you have mastered to grow? Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience.

Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings.

Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better.

Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others.

While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown.             ",human
"I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the most hard part that a engineer has to take very series?.

If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. My mom told me that this is a good job, but it's a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didn't like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that i'm talking about didn't like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class.

Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. On Saturdays and Sundays i work with my dad. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i don't have be like him all day in those hot days. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. When i'm older i would get a good job, and i would help my dad, and my mom even dough they told me that when get older they are going to go back to El Salvador , but i'm still going to help them.

I think that i would give engineering a chance if not i'm going to find another job. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i don't think i'm going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My teachers tell me that i'm smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel. I get mad when don't understand something. i haven't done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything

I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask. This essay made me think more about what job would i like to do in the future. I think that i would stay with the engineering job i would like to put all my thoughts in to it and get a good college degrees, and get the job that i dream off. I think that my dream wold come true, and if it does or doesn't well i guess i would learn another thing i pay to go to college and get that job. i will try to make all my family happy and help all of them. I'm really good in everything if i only put my mind into it.

To begin with, the people there are well mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies.

Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make a honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents.

Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well made and created.

"Should students graduate in three years?

Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year.

Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students don't know what career they want or they don't know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesn't know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesn't know what to study and can't find a job yet.

Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old.

Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes.

In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.  ",human
"Have you ever thought about asking other people for advice? Perhaps, people sometimes talk to more than one person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next step, and that person will stop thinking about their choice too much.

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. One time, I planned to clean the car. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. Moreover, it will help you to make better choice in your life. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice.

Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.",human
"A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it never will solve the problem if you don't try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday.

When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it.

If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a really good statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way. I agreed to this statement because of all the reasons I was talking about in the other paragraphs.",human
"Technology is good for many stuff. For example, technology is good for research, homework or otherstuff. But, they their is a negative effects on people's lives. Technology can be use for bad stuff like in internet, researching bad stuff in the website. But like I said technology is good for many stuff

Technology is good for research because when your doing a project or study for test. But you dont know anything you just research in the website. Also good for your homework, you can find the answer or get informtion rewrite on your word. But, technology has negative effects on people's lives.

(I was talking a the computer).

Technology is good for play game. For example, I have a Playstation Four and so many video game. I play all day not get bored. But then, much too technology can cost your eye to get hurt or loose your eye sight. Their a other thing is bad for us as a teen. We waste so much time on video game rather spend time on doing our homework,prove writing skill, reading.

technology (phone) is good for communication with other people in fairy away places. For example, My family live in Generic_City, but my aunt and unlce live in Generic_City. But we use a phone to call them if their fine and we talk them about our life. Even tho were fary away them we still communicat with them. ",human
"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Online school is for every student.                         ",human
"One place i would like to go visit in this world would be portorico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because i want to experince how it is to live there or how school is for them. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe i might start being greatful for what i have and they dont and i would start helping others mor often.

One reason i would go to portorico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear,what they eat, and what they do on daly it would be intersting seeing all that and i would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a portorican.

Another reason i would love to go to portorico is because at the USA i am not greatful for what i have and maybe if if i go over to portorico i will be greatful for what i have because i will see the difference of how i live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealth and i am over here throwing my food away because i dont want it.

My final reason for wanting to go to portorico is because i will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because i want to see if they are different than El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay.

In conclution I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and i want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. I want to be greatful of everything that i am able to have and they dont and maybe share the stuff that i have and they dont.

"Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later.

Do you agree with the Former Prime Minister Of England Winston Churchill quote? There others take this quote in a positive way or in a negative way. People that have enthusiasm will most likely to take the quote to their own hearts that doesn't want to quit or gives up yet. Like the quote says from failure to failure that will follow up to a pursuit of success. So here comes the reasons of enthusiasm in the quote.

Learning something new that actually comes up great. A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasn't easy for their own lives. Like example someone wants to speak a different language but failed many times,that actually doesn't wants to give up on the language that trying to learn. And it's better to make mistakes for something greater later in life. Like if you failed a lot and that you learn from your own mistakes from those mistakes will do something greater in the future.

Others may disagree that quote doesn't fit right their own selves and for being negative. Others careless about the enthusiasm how it will help for their lifetime. So they don't have the positive attitude and thinks about nothing at all. Negativity is the main point that they fail to fail without trying the best and the enthusiasm with them in life it's worthless to them in life.

Although some people don't agree with this quote for being negative,however others and I agree of the enthusiasm quote because to learn something new in life and to make mistakes for something great later. With this quote I agree with the power of the enthusiasm in lives. People should take the quote like it's a everyday thing in life    ",human
"One time, my friend used all type of drogas for example: cocaine, marihuna, ciggarett,alcohol,etc. But one day he asked me what school am i going? i said Generic_School, can i go with you? he asked me, of course i said. I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing.

"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.

The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.

Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.

Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.

I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",human
"Do you think that high schoool should only be 3 years instead of 4 years. well some might say it would be better having 3 year's of school other then 4 year's. but the way to achieve it is difficult.

I think that school should be only 3 years. beacause some student don't really want to be in school for too long. this can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. it would give the students a higher chance to focus in school and then head out to college for those who are interested.

I belive that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 year's. it would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it but other's might say that they perfer to be in school longer. because of friend's or liking to learn alot and it no rush toward them for they are interted in learning.

Generic_School, have different kind of career that student can choose for study in their life, also there is people who help to select which subject is better, they make opinion about why you have to take that career. Hear ideas and opinions sometime make you to do best things and get successful in the life.

Some students are thinking about choose Science, Why they prefer Science?, They believe that science could bring it better opportunities in their life, for example: Exist important people who created tools that are availabe to save life of people. There is more people who invented different kind of instruments, the microscope is one, this tool really that is very important, this one help us to see stars more close or any other thing that are a far of us. Those are some examples that why we took the decision of choose Science, does not matter what the instructors of the University said.

Generic_School, also have the career of study History, some guys voted for that one, But Why?, just because for a few reason, one of them is that they want to learn more about how each war started, Life's Presindents, etc. History is a great subject that teach us many important events that we even dont know that was real in the life, however, at end of the day just you have the option to do waht you like and want.

"Many schools have partnerships with local companies. It allow students to explore certain professions. Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. Sharing money to grow the business. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school.

In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation.

Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.

The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.

The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",human
"Always being active, determined to become successful can lead to lots of accomplishments; however, some people think it is necessary to procrastinate. Thomas Jefferson quoted

""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.""

Having the mind set of being able to accomplish assignments, and being active in anything can lead to being successful in life, having the ability to not procrastinate, and people start to see that a person is responsible or trustworthy. These are reasons why it is important to be motivated, and to be able to accomplish assignments.

Having the mind set of being able to accomplish assignments, and being active in anything can lead to being successful in life. Having the motivation of being able to accomplish assignments on time and the accuracy is important; therefore, it shows that a person is organize. Organization is important because it shows that a person can arrange equipment or utensils neatly, for it helps in the future. Accomplishing assignments can lead to success in life and becoming financially stable because of finishing assignment on time and by completing them. The sensation of having motivation to complete assignments and being successful in life is amazing.

It is important to keep track on which assignments has to be completed because having a incomplete assignments passed due can cause trouble. It makes it harder for a person to finish an assignment at the last minute because of the rush. Procrastinating is not the key of finishing any assignments on time and by having the assignments accurate. Being able to complete assignments on time is precisely important because it can help in the future with any assignments that crosses.

Having the mind set of being able to accomplish assignments, and being active in anything can lead to people seeing a person as responsible or trustworthy. People can see a person as responsible because they complete assignments on time or before hand. People do not have to tell a person repeatedly to have an assignment completed by a certain date. Other people can see a person as trustworthy because they stick to what they asked to do. They finish the assignment before hand or on time, which makes people trust them more. Accomplishing assignments can help reach goals, and it can help in the future.

"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.",human
"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",human
"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. As a result, Do you think it will help student's in the future?",human

"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.",human
"Jonh once said, Technology had positive and negative effects on people's life, people complete many tasks without having contact with others. Some people said that technology is good because they can do many thinks, like find books, information and do works more easy. Other people thinks differents, they said that technology is bad because had negative effects on people life, if people do not know how to use it, they can will have problems because sometimes people send archivements or informations to the wrong person or publish it. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons.

First, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks,

for example, search specific information more fast.

To do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot.

Second,the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced. Then, the purpose of use technology if for good reasons and with the technology always people will have easy infornation but they wil not learn the technology caused that people lose their time playing videos games and visiting wrongs wed site. However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. It are creating a obsession in the people, many kids and adolocents have problems with they vision, because pass a lot of time in the cell phone, computer or playing videos games causing cancer, tumor or lose their vision.

Finally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. Some parents permit that they kids use technology, but they do not have the contol of them the adolecents use technology for have fun sometimes causing problems. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. Also, the technology is very advance that the people are creating robot to make more easy the works, but is is a ploblem because the robot will be remove the people jobs, causing that the people leaving whithout job.

In conclusion, the technology had negative effects on people's life, creating obsession on people and doing more easy the ability to do works,but for people tha use technology a lot need to have a limit, and if they have acounts with important information they need to protect it with a strong password, if they have kids and permit that use technology they need to control them what they do and put a limit how much can use the computer, cell phone or videos games. people have to put their own limit to control technology when it cause problems.",human
"On my experiences I think It would be impossible to change the first impressions becuase one different people have different types of characteristics traits. For example one of my friend who move to text,her characteristic traits I remember she was so nice to everybody when she use to live her in virginia and also she use to get along with everbody at the school. This shows that type of impressions that my friend Generic_Name has.

Another example is when I was in lunch line with my friend Generic_Name,a spanish girl touch my hair,I did not know that girl was the girlfriend of the boy that was in one of my class. Until then when I was going to my third class I ask that boy if he could help me find this class because I did not know where all my classes were,when he came up to me to explain the schuedule and told me and him had the same class,his girlfriend look at me mad. This shows that at first the girl of the boy was nice and then the girl of the boy was kind of mean to mean.

Last example everbody has different types of impressions,it could be in a good way or bad way. Sometimes people impressions might change or they might still be the same.",human
"Changing our school meun to much healthier choice's is a good idea because its good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired and you won't have theenergy to do anything. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice.

Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. most students don't workout so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.

I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.

in conclusion changing the schools cafeterias meun to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members so they could stay healthy and focus.",human
"When you need advice do you just talk to one person or more? Its way better telling people the things that happen so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. An yes i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick.

But i still asking people for some advice is better because like i said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if if your in the right or wrong. An they will always be there for you no matter what, thats why i say yes. because you never know what they will tell you or do about the things you tell them but if there real friends they'll stick by yotu side no matter what.",human
"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else.

no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework.

In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people)

they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.

Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer.

I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do )

to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue.

and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter.

In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.",human
"I believe that gaining life experience and learning from your mistakes and working hard, comes when we are always doing something and accomplish more. Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life .

To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer.

Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue.

Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.

In conclusion, by working hard and always doing something makes, you to gain life experience and more opportunities and to accomplish more. To accomplish something is not easy, you have to face a lot of difficulties and facing those difficulties and get over it that's what meant by accomplish .It will walk you through a lot to accomplish something in your life, you just have to keep going and to work hard and never give up and all of that will pays off by being success in your life .",human
"Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.",human
"I should agree because it can make your grades higher by joining sports, after school subjects or classes, and it make you more smarter and more. In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesn't want to participate because they're lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up.

I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didn't followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies.

If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities.

And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesn't want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\

I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year. Before I also don't want to go to after school classes, but when I got a really bad grades I started to go to a after school classes and finish work and do retakes and here I got some good grades.",human

I belive that the the people that found a way of making there own decision were so confidence that they had to decided on what to do. but if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decison to make. because if they had made there own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. but anyway people who are confidence can make there own choices.

other however the ones that need assistent might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. those people ask for help. they ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a more higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. it all depend's on the person who is determen to decide.

i suggest that both ways all depend on a person because we all have our difffent way's and many can cause a huge impact on people life the more info you know the better you have to understand what path you are taking because new's had spred that people are making wrong decision which led to to be indanger.

"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then don't know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board.

Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when you're working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages.

Most teachers don't allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyone's going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school it'll be easier for them to call you.

Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldn't have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldn't be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and that's why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.",human
"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve.

Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and that's the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didn't understand the unit because it's was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didn't work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but what's important is that I put my time and efforts on it.

Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.

Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.

Many people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that you're lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to.

In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you don't try your best to achieve your goal and it's the worst thing that you could've ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.",human

this a good council because if the city do curfew all teenager can be safe and they can have resposabilidad with dont breaking the law, with a curfew the city can try to keep safe all citizen and the young people can keep out of troubles.

My first reason why is important to try to make a curfew in the city is because in the nigth is too dangerous for the citizen and especially is more dangerous for young people,if we have a curfew we can keep all citizen and the most important the teenagers safe.

My second reason is because the parents do not have to worry about the teenagers because if the city do a curfew, we can keep the teenager out of troubles, and the parents can feelling good because everybody wiil be in home safe.

My third reason is because if the city do curfew we can keep the teenagers out of drugs and alcholismo, because the young people is the first coustomer of drugs, if we have a curfew we can take away of the jail at a lot teenagers. A curfew can keep safe at all teenager and all citizen.

"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life.

Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when you're angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. That's the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you don't want to end up one day behind bars.

Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, it's most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friend's trophies. I was so mad that I wasn't thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes it's better to make the right choices because it releases our stress.

Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.

Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision.                                 ",human
"Can a possitive attitude be the key to success in life or should we live the way we believe is better?

Daily we live the way we want to. But, sometimes we don't consider the important things that can make us success in life. Attitude can be one of those facts that can make us success. There are some specific reasons about the importance of attitude and why we should consider this or not a fact to success in life.

The importance of attitude is a fact to success in life. As we know, we need a possitive attitude to get some things in life. For example, in a job to get better opportunities we need a possitive attitude to develop our skills.

To live a healthy life. For example, if we have a possitive attitude we will avoid dangerous sickness.

Easies way to live. For example, being relaxed is a result of having a possitive attitude.

In conclusion, a possitive attitude is the key of success. It teach us the easies way to live successfully in life. In my opinion, i agree with the statement that a possitive attitude is the key of success.                            ",human
"Some people agree with the statement ''success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' because the failure help to learn how other's to be prepared and better understanding. But many people disagree with Churchill's for the reason what they don't believe in the failure because if they fail something they do better the next time. Since, no one is perfect everybody have something bad and something good this don't make a different the other's.

Although many people concern the failure how something the need due for doing a better person in the life but that does the means they can't due. Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something.

Additionally, many people don't believe in the faillure they say is somenthing happed in the life for doing a better person. If they fail a class or don't pass the class they keep trying and never give up. Surely, with failers they learn from the expirence they will not loss the enthusiasm.

Ask you can see failure is not always a good way to major sucess. One need to success failure is put a attention and due a better person and trying hard. If this people trying the things wiil be better in they were doing. Although all many people are success with failure.

Truely, failure is part of life and we need to understand our failers so the we can successed. By understanding our failers learn how doing better and not worry about the failers. Since they are worry about the failers one can have more enthusiasm to success.        ",human
"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it

Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",human
"Have you ever had someone to shared wisdom and experience with you before? A friend that has been with you for years. You trust that person, shared your wisdom and experiences with that person. My best friend Generic_Name has shared her wisdom and experiences to me. She help me with art things, how she become best friend with me, and how she like to help so many people.

She was home school Kindgarden through Third grade, but when she went the Generic_School, and she was put to Third grade. Before Generic_Name met me, she didn't know anyone, she had a different teacher and class. When she in Generic_Name's class, I walk in the class, that is when she first met me ,and Generic_Name told Generic_Name that ""Generic_Name is the same grade as you and you guy can be friends"". After that Generic_Name, and I became friends very fast, as the years past, our friendship grew and now we are in the eighth grade, we still best friend.

Generic_Name likes to help so many people like I do. When somebody drops something, she would pick it up and give it to the person who drops it. She holds doors for teacher, and students even have their hands full with books, or papers. When a friend needs help, she would try to help her friend the best she can because she cares about her friends; want to help them the best can and, she don't give give so easily. She likes to help teachers by help passing out papers, running errands for them, and doing a favor for a teacher.

She is also good at help people with art things because she and I are taking art class this years, but her art class comes first and I have art class second. She likes to tell me what the art homework is ahead after the class is over, and going to her next class. When I need help of what I should include, I would ask Generic_Name, and she would give me some advise of what I include in my art drawing. I would said to Generic_Name "" That is great idea, Generic_Name, thank you so much""!

Some times to have a good idea, she will get a computer look for some good ideas, or used your imagination.

Having a friend to share their wisdom and an experiences to is meaningful because you and your best friend have gone through so many thing with you, and have been by your side withe all this time. Having your best is can help you get through challenging things, or be there for one another when they need you the most. My best Generic_Name has share her wisdom and experiences with me; how she help me with art things, how she becomes my best friend, and how she so many people. I am so happy and very thankful that Generic_Name is my best friend because without her help, I wouldn't make it this far at all.",human
"83% of people say that the idea of extending the school day by two hours is a bad plan, For those who dont know the average school day is abut 8:00 am -2:45 pm. The time that students get out of school should not change because the changing of the time would case cognitive impairment and students not having inf time for their jobs after school.

The idea of extending the school day would case cognitive impairment, For example, When my friend got sleepy for doing a school project late last Kite he would constantly forget he had homework and always feel uninterested in doing stuff, When I got tired I have forgotten to check the time that I had to get to work.

The plan would case students not having inf time for their jobs after school. For instance, When I had to stay after school for a test I had to miss work, and my manager had to cut my pay for messing work, Because i had to stay after school I lost my chains to get paid for my hard work.

Some people say that the plane would give students a four-day week than are five-day week. However it still dose not address that facts that people well not retain much memory of what they lend do to long school hour, and not having inf time of finding a job. It would be best to not to change are present schools start times and end times.",human
"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful.

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow.                                                      ",human
"Some schools have programs for youngers and olders student why they make programs like this or how can they help each others Okey. This program help both students to learn about what are the responsability of the olders students and the youngers student to see what they going to do when they becomes a older and the olders student can learn from de younger student.

The olders student can teach about mistake because every one have different mistake they can teach younger student to do right things and can help each others

The yourger student can also learn about theres mistakes they make the program to thye olders students can go to visit the yourger student to help them, to them they can help the youngers student to learn from theres mistakes the olders student can teach the younger student about the life to do the right things

The youngers student needs the olders student like the olders student need a adult to they can say dont do this is the same the younger student need the olders student they can help each others if the youngers studetn have a promble or a question they can ask the olders student to do right this some student of the youngers schools they dont know english the olders student can help them some times the olders student needs the youngerts students to do somenthing like if the olders sstudent dont know somenthing they can ask the younger students if someone has problems with something they can help each others they can do many dinfferent things together there are many types about programs that can help younger students and olders student sometimes if is a fight with youngers students the olders student can stop them and say to them to do the right thins because in this life everyone has mistakes nobody is perefect they can help each others to the rights things and the different about this two kinds of student is the olders student have more responsability and the younger student have responsabily but the dont have much like the olders students or the olders students dont have the mu\ch responsability from the adult one time my dad tell me that when he was youngers he need help with somenting but he dont want to tell a older person he tell me if one time i need help with something i can ask a older one to help me to do tghe right this and to learn from ours mistakes we can help each others olders students are important because they can help the younger student to know about this life the younger students start to learn more about this life the olders student know what is right and what not right they can help each others to practice the armony of this two kinds of students the youngers student can learn much about thir sames mistakes know a big problem has the olders student dont want to help the youngers students the diferent betweet is the olders student know the right things and the bads things so thas why the can help each others

"I Disagree the school board is adding one and half hours each day of school. We have regular school days seven hours a day. Also some people stay afterschool that palce two more hours of school. That is nine hours of school. I usally stay afterschool for peer helpers every wenesdays. That helps me to get my communite servers up I already have six hours, I just need nine more hours that is it. But either way I love helping special kid's and also I will love to finish this year helping PROPER_NAME, even though I'm about to finish my community severs hours I will still help the kids.

Anyways this about me disagreeing with school borad. What I'm really trying to say we wake up at six o'clock or five o'clock and we come to school and we do our work. Some of as have good grades and some of as are trying our best. We recpect our teachers as much as we could, we do our work and we some how understand what the teacher gives us. Also we try our best as we could.

Another example that you can't add more hours to our school is that some students have sports afterschool not in school out of school. Even though there is sports in my school they already sign up for other sports. Some students wants to just go home and be in her/she home and just study quietly instead of afterschool, afterschool is every loudly its not for everybody. All of us have good examples and they will tell why its a bad idea and they will disagree with you. But I know where you guys are coming from you want us to have more education.

I really hope you don't add more hours because seven hours is enough for us to learn. We got other things to do afterschool. If you add more hours, students will be picked up every last period and not even be there when the teacher is teaching. Also we will not have afterschool activity because students can't stay afterschool past six o'clock. Also if you add more hours parents will take out their childern and they will put them in a different school. That what I think about you adding more hours to school. I hope you think about it and think about if your idea we are actally taking benfits.

Why I disagree with school board is wrong that you guys are adding more hours of school. For example, like I said I stay afterschool on wendesday's and seven hours of school place the two more hours for afterschool. It gives me headace and our late bus is the last one to go, so basically I go home five o'clock and sometime when the late bus comes early I go home like 4:48pm. When I go home I eat and take a shower I watch for a little bit I say I'm take a nap it doesn't end up a nap it ends up I wake up at six o'clock. Also sometimes when I don't stay afterschool, I take nap at home I wake up at eleven o'clock, I go to sleep at three o'clock. This why I want don't you guys to add more hours because it will effect our sleeps.",human
"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     ",human
"Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I want you to consider policy one for various reasons. The first reason why we should have cell phones is because some parents like to check up on there son's and that can't happen in policy two, but in policy one we can do that and if you are a parent wouldn't you like to check up on your son or daughter? Second, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to bring them at all because say we forgot our homework at home and say we already missed a day of homework and if we miss another one we will get a detention, we can just call our mom during lunch break or passing period and tell her if she can bring our home work. Lastly, say we are in a lock down because someone had a gun in the campus and the man or women cuts the power off so no one can call through the telephones we can just grab our cell phones and call the police. I'm not asking you to approve it I'm asking to considerate please.",human
"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",human
"This someone i will talk about is important, because he is my father,

.1. my father is someone important for me because he is the man that takes care of me from the day i born,

.2. he is so nice,

.3. he never get mad from me.

.4

. he always good with any body

.5

. he help people who need help

.6

.he is so generous with us.

EVERY MOMENT AND EVRY DAY I spend it with my dad i learn something important and useful from him about any thing,As we know our parents are older than us so they had more experience than any of us also they help us in many things and when when we need any thing or we dont know what to do in any situation at any time ,every adults experiences who ever they are they have to be learn from any situation they put in so they may be know what to do so we must know from them to not put in this situation.

Thats why we have to share information, all of this things that is my parents done and told me about and they also told me about what they do at the past and what shouldnt i do now or any time and, there advises and stories helps me always to not fall in trouble so i must do what they told me; as we know there is a reason for every thing and the reason for why i love my parents because my dad and my mom work and have more experience in their job to told me about and for my collage, and they are the important people that care about me,and their experience can help me in my future job a lot.

Sometimes my father takes us to the place that there is a lot of old people there to se mt grand mother and every old man or lady tell us beautiful stories about what is the interesting things they do in there past and what are they jobs and what must they do in their jobs and my grand father there told me about his past in military and what he do in it and where did he go with the army in a period of time.

from the last paragraph about what i said i took more experience in jobs and another things but the most thing i got from this stories is wisdom i cant write it but i know what it means, it means that share experience and wisdom with other people to make them learn what to do in any time to make it pass from grandfathers to fathers to sons .",human
"I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best'' because not everyone always learns from their mistakes,the problem may have already affected them,the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everyone learns from there mistakes. some people cannot remember if they had a mistake a long time ago and that mistake comes up again, for example, my brother had failed his drivers test and when he took it again he failed again. Furthermore, when your nervous and you had a problem, Some people get trauma and they think of that problem and they are afraid of doing it again, For example, I missed a tackle at football once and I was scared of doing it again, so when I had the chance of doing it again I thought about if i would miss it like last time.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because the problem may have had already affected them so they would not be able to change it. some people may have made a really big mistake so they would not be able to be the best if they have had that chance. For example, somebody on the news had the death penalty for murder so they would not be able to change that. Furthermore, people have had the opportunity to get something great but they chose not to, they cannot go back and change that. for example my sister got this award but she refused to take it so she cant go back.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best'' because the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes. A lot of people had had many mistakes in their life and failed to achieve their goal, for example, my cousin wanted to be a lawyer but then had a lot of problems with what she was doing so she quit law school. when people have a lot of mistakes they tend to get more mistakes and then they end up trying to figure out how to deal with all them. for example, I was taking a test and I tried to figure out some of the questions at once but then I ended up mixing all of them up.

In conclusion,I disagree with the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everybody can acknowledge what do do after they have made a mistake, the problem may have already have had a negative impact on them already, And the way to be great is to rarely have any mistakes",human
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. well i gree with the statement, because how your impressions is sonting you can not change like me when i see my familly my impressions are good because is the first thing i shod to dent, like when i see my mather i express my impressions to her are sonting diferent because i feel happy to see her or when i take to her and sonting i do to my bothers or my friends.

Tirst, the impressions is sonting almost not change, like my friends in school oneday i talden i liven the school the first impression they put waus sad becuase i live the school and they do not want to me live the school they want to me staing with thend, but i take to my friends i i sead to dent i have to go se my mather i my contry because i miss her like my brothers i have see my familly and 7 years the impression when i saed this to my friends was so sopraision.

Seccond, when i go see my mother and brothers in my contry for the first time the impressions they put in ther faese whas so happy to see me one more time after 7 years. My mother she was more happy to see me, but when my brothers see for the first time the impressions they put was so different then the impression my mom put to me they sead to me i do not looke nothing equal like bifore now i look like a big men and not like boy.

For example, how i expression my impression is sonthing special like when i do not see my familly or friends and 3 or 4 years i will be sad and my impression is going to be depress. Impression are so many way to expression like the time they tolk me my father was death i was 5 years old my impression was like nathing because i do not comprehend what my mom tolk me of my father.

In conclusion. the first impressions are almost imposisible to change the is true because how impression are is sonting ameising you expression things when you see sowant or people do you no see in aloge time like example in my familly i have not see my granfather but i now the firts time i ging to see my granfather my impression is going to be many.

"Many people believe that they should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter.

Other people believe that they should make their own decisions.

It is good for people who make their own decision, so that way they learn from their own mistakes, they need to learn how to get up whenever they feel in trouble. People who make their own decisions they know the consequences, but they know how to grow up as a person, and beat up any problem that they have. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for advices because older people seems to have more experience in some topics.

First, people who made mistakes in life, they need to learn how to not made that mistake again.

If someone is there just telling people what to do and what not to do, people will never learn how to not made that mistake again.

Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for some help, but they do not have to tell them exactly what do.

If someone need help in something, they need to paid close attention, and see how is that person doing something.

Due to the fact that many people made mistakes, they have to learn how to do decisions by themselves.

Second, people who has been guided by their parents, but their parents are not with for them. Since their parents are not with them, and there is difficult time where some people will need the help of their parent, but because they was use to it, that their parents do everything for them, they will never know what to do.

Because of that, people will never know how to get up and do everything by themselves.

Sometimes, it is easier just to ask someone how to do something, but sadly one day they will be in the same situation, and they will never know how solve it.

Third, people who make their own decisions in life they already know the consequences, but they know how to beat them and grow up as a person.

Sometimes, people do no like to make their own decisions because they are scare to the consequences, but that is a way to grow up as a person. Also, that is how people are a better someone in the future by making their own decisions.

If people are afraid to the consequences of their own decision so that mean that they are not grow up.

In conclusion, people who made mistakes in life, they will learn from those mistakes.

People learn how to not make mistakes by making mistakes, but if people had never made a mistake in their life so that mean that their is someone who guide them through everything in life.

People are not perfect, they learn from their own decisions.

Also, people who is use to be guide by a parent, they do not know how get up whenever they are in a difficult time.

Parents will never be beside people to hold their hands all the time, and that is why people have to learn how to get up.

People who make their own decisions they already know that there are consequences, but they know how beat them, and grow up as a person, and be a better someone.

Because of all this, people believe that they need to make their owns decisions.

It is okay to ask for some help, but not with everything.",human
"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why

I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go.

In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and there's no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you should'nt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective don't get involved as much as your other friends is.

Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people don't like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials.

In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students don't have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. It's just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to King's Dominion and once your there you well be like I've earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something that's giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view I'm working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do.

Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they don't because we're a family and something we always say when we're down is ''dream, believe, achieve ''. This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also you're parents and family .

In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you don't have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with what Albert Einstein said. Some people think its the other way around were knowledge is more important than imagination. imagination and knowledge could be used for a lot of things. I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination.

Imagination is something you need to come up with things. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it. Imagination can help you a lot, You can use your imagination to your advantage, you can use it keep you busy. you can build things, draw things,and create things from your imagination. you can do many more things with your imagination. Imagination has no limits.

In order to get knowledge of something, you would need to use your imagination. You would need to take notes and study from it. you use your imagination to get knowledge. You can learn so much from your imagination and its very useful. we have to be careful with our imagination and our knowledge. Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them.

In conclusion I think imagination is more important. We use out imagination every day. We learn things every day. It would be hard without imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. You can also use you imagination while you read. We wouldnt know much because we get our knowledge from our imagination.               ",human
"Have you ever been to a park ? Chances are you have, It doesn't matter what kind but you most certainly had fun right. Going to parks Is always fun, mostly because of the activities you do at the park to have fun. At the park you always find a fun activity to do, and people enjoy doing those fun activities because you get to play with other people, you are able to make new friends, and most of those activities can help you live a healthy life.

When people go to the park the tend to do fun activities, and most of the time they play those activities with friends and or other people. And when you play those activities with someone else you can have more fun. Another good reason for playing with someone else Is you also get to talk to them. And when you start playing with someone It could lead up to more people joining, and will make It even more fun. So remember when you go to the park try to bring a friend so you both can have lots of fun at the park.

People like going to the park to do fun activities, and when they go they often start to talk to new people. When they talk to new people theres a high chance of them becoming friends, So another reason why they enjoy the park Is they can make new friends. And who doesn't like to make friends, as a result they can meet up at the park and have fun together. And then they'll eventually make a more friendly status with each other. So going to park can be enjoyed in different ways, theres a chance you might just make a new friend.

Finally my last reason why people go to the park Is they can enjoy the park and the activities and also live a healthy life. You might not even notice that most of the activities we do at the park can be positive and help us with a healthy life. Its Is always a positive thing to live a healthy life you can do so much by keeping your life healthy. Thats why most people like going to the park you can have fun and be healthy at the same time. These were reasons why people like going to the park, plus who doesn't like the park.

People like going to the park for many reasons, and all of these reason were positive. Who doesn't want to play with friends or other people, who doesn't want to make new friends, or even have and live a healthy life. So If you hate parks just remember these reasons why you should go, It can make your like very happy.",human
"I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",human
"""Stop doing that, your cousin cut his hand because he was doing the same thing"". A lot of times people say an example to make you know what would happen if you continue doing it. But, is the example the best way to influence people? Yes, an example will make you know that you are doing something bad, it will let you know what are the consequences of it, and you know that the example influence others, because you can see that your parents are the most important example in your life; they are going to make you as a person.

When you are doing something bad and the people see it, they will probably tell you an example of something that you are doing something bad or innapropiate; for example, when you are climbing a tree, your mom would tell you stop doing that, your sister broke her arm because she was climbing that tree, that is going to make you think if you are doing something good or bad. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they don't want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you don't think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad. When people tell you a good example to stop doing something, it will make you know that you are doing something bad.

A lot of times you are doing something, and you don't know the consequences of your action, maybe, it can break your arm, or it can send you to the hospital; but when people tell you an example it will let you know the actions; for example, if you are listening to music very loud, you couldn't know that it can make your ears very bad, but when people tell you turn the music down, my sister's ears are very bad because she was listening to music very loud; after that you know that you better stop doing that, because it will bring you very bad consequences, and you do not want that, so you would stop. Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk. An example can help you to know the consequences of your actions.

A lot of people say that you are who you are because of your parents, and that is right, your parents are the most important example for you. They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. The parents are your most important example and influence.

We saw that an example can make us think what is good and what is wrong, it is going to tell us the consequences of our actions, it will make you think that you are doing something bad, and we can see that the example influences you because we have our parents, we are going to be the same as them, because they are the people that is going to teach us how to act. So yea, the example is the best way to influence people.",human
"For student that try to graduate early. Is a good idea to graduate early if they are thinking go to college or if they try to work. Student need to be able to take class out of the school. Some student will need to take class in summer school. For some student is more difficult to graduate early because they need work for help in theirs houses. For make this possible student must need to be; determine, preparete, and flexible.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be determine. they need to be determine for be able to past all their class an exams. and example is; ""I have a friend that is graduate early and she is taking class in the evenings"". Student that are determine is going to be more easy to finish high school early. Yet if you are planing to go to college is a good idea to graduate early.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be preparate. They need to be preparete to take more class during school year. They need to be preparete to have a full skehchule and not be able to take elective class. they need to prepare because they maybe need to take class during summer. They need to be prepare to pass all their class and exams that they need for graduate early and not to stress out.

Student that try to graduate early they must need to be flexible. Sometimes you have to be flexible for what you have to do like if you work and go school if you try to graduate early you have to be able to stop working and focus just in school. Students need to be flexible for new things and face in the best way. Like if you find difficult in one of your class you should ask your teacher for help. Student need to be flexible because if they take class in the evening or online is going to be different and maybe difficult for them but they need to be able to find a way to be successful.

Is good for student to graduate early from high school. Yes is good if they feel they can do it and pass everything what they need to pass.

"Thomas Jefferson was a president, and he wrote this to help people to do their work always.

It is really good when we are doing our work and it will be done when we doing it always and we will learn it to do it will be easy for ourself.

Somtime it will be boring to do our work always but it is good that we can learn it really good if we do it always.

I am doing my work and my job and my sport always because it will help me to remember it and also doing always is good that can learn us till we can teach it for example: when we are reading a book always it will help us to learn a lot about everything the people that they are not doing good and always there work and there job they are lazy people and they will not learn anything when they do not doing it always.

If we think about it we can see the diffrent between the people that they doing always are better than the people that they do not doing it always so like: doing homwork always, sleeping on time always, going to sport always, going to job always and etc.

We will help the people and tell them to there there work always we should help them.

In the first when the school start i was not good and i was not doing my homworks and studing always until my friends help me and told me to do my work always and i am glad that i learn this to do my work always and i want everyone to do there work always never forget it.

"It has being said that a positive attitude is the key of success in life. Many people might think different from what i do. I agree with this statement, because being positive in life makes me happy and when i am happy i do my work with happinest. Maybe not all the time my work is going to work out but at least i had fun doing it. During the time when i am doing my work to reach the goal, i am always being positive. When i play soccer for the school, and we have hard games aginst others schools who have a better team than we do, but no matter what i am always positive. Also when i am at work i have stuff to do before leaving my work. i dont like going home late, so i am always positive that i will be finishing all the stuff so i can leave work early.

Doing my homework every night is a stuggle beacause i work everyday, and i do not get time to do it before going to work. So what i tried to do is do all my work fast at work so like that i can go home and get my homework done.

Playing soccer for the school is the most fun activity i have done in my life, because i get to meet new people and compete against better players. Sometimes i have to play against some players that are really good at soccer and i might not have a chance to beat them but that doesnt mean i will stop being positive. I am always telling my self i can do it. I tried to pass my positive attitude to my team mates. When everyone starts being positive we play better games and we beat the good teams that we could not defeat a year ago.

I love my work, but sometimes i am to tired and i just want to go home.

I do not get leave my job till i finish cooking all the stuff that need to be ready for the next day. Also i got to clean the floor an the kitchen. If i want to leave early i need to be positive, that i will finish every thing fast. Like that i would not have to leave late. The good thing about my work is that i get to work with my best friend, he is always positive like me, so we do our job faster but well done.

When i get homework and i have to work the night i just want to cry. But i tell my self that if finish all the work fast. I would get to go home and do my homework. i would not have to go to sleep late, beacuse of my work and homework. Being positive helps me finish everything fast so can go to sleep fast.

In conclusion, Being positive is the key of success in life beacause, being positive gives you happinest and makes you do your job with more joy. Many people should change their negative attitude because neggative people never succed in life. When you are a positive person more of your goals are going to be achive. Also just not that you will make other people start being positive.",human
"Most of the people thinks that having a positive attitude is the key to success. It has been said that a good attitude is the best way to reach the goals. I totally agree that is important to have a positive attitude to success in life.

Having a good attitude can helps people to get a job. For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are.

Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didn't gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people.

A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life.

Other people thing that is not important to have a good attidute to succes in life. Because, sometime you can be in a bad moon and attitude is something that you can't control. So, attidute is something is simething that can you hold.

In conclucion, having a positive attitude can help you reach your goals because a good attitude demostrete personality, education, and how careful you are with other people. Having a positive attitude can tell how your parents grothw you up and how you really care to learn a high education.    ",human
"Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. Lot's of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they don't start in a young age. In my opinion young student's should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young student's shouldn't start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family.

My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age student's can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young student's get's lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, student's get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kid's have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take.

My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, student's can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they don't have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid want's to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, student's knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the student's a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, that's a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute.

Some would argue that student's shouldn't start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kid's are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , it's nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career.

In conclusion, student's should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world. So now, Do you think young student's should start their career in a young age?",human
""" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you"" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.",human

"There is a quote about success contsists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. people have different opinion about failure, some say failure is the worst thing that can happen to you, and it makes you not want to try your best on something . however in my opinion, I thing failure is the best thing that can happened to us humans because. it gives us the the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it, it makes us humans learn from our mistakes, and it gives us the strenth

First failure gives us the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it because, I have fail before when I was trying out for the school soccer team, I work so hard for it I go to training everytime, and be there on time but i did not made the team I was so sad that i did not made the team but it give me the corrage to try more and more.

Second failure makes us humans learn from our mistakes. we humans are not parfect we all make mistake and learn for it. it like me I am a teenager who cant speak english everwell, whenever I spoke to someone my age thay kept on making fun of me, but I never give up on myseif I know that if I learn from my mistakes I will be better at speaking english.

Finally failure make us stronger. in life in other to get what we want we have to go throught failure it teach us to be strong and to nevergive up on yourseif. everyone go through failure for example president Donold Trump in other to be a president he has to go through som failure.

In conclusion failure is the best thing that can happend to us humans. it teach us to be strong in anything that we want and to learn from our mistakes. failure play a enthusiasm in our lives that makes the world a better place.         ",human

"Do you think it is a good idea for students to start their career such a young age and stress about it? I will tell you guys why it is not a good idea. Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet.

Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet. Students already have enough stress and, they do not need anymore of that. Students already have stress from school, sports, home problems, and the list can go on.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career. Therefor, students need more time to think about what they want to do in life. It takes time to think about what students what to be to grow up. There is a lot of things to do for your career so students just have not found the right one yet. They need time to make sure what they really want to do in life and they feel it is the right one.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school. Students can make their own mind when the thing it is the right time and, also they think they really think what they want to be when they grow up just give them time. To my congestion it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career as they enter high school because they need time to think about it well.",human
"The limitations of human contact due use technology had negative effects in peoples's lives. Imagine how many accidents happen in they week because the use of the technology using programs a lot. Generic_Name was driving and playing his favoitrs games online,and he did not look to the red light. Limitatios with humans can cause many problems in your life. We need to have limit technology use. Technology gave negative effects in time with family, driving while you are testing, and energy electricity.

First of all, families have limitation of time to talk about their problems because they dedicate more time to technony. For example, Generic_Name was a girls in public high school. She was talking with an old man; the man was looking everyday, and she do not figure out because the man told her that he was in another country. Next, she did not talk with the families and she was one more of many young victim of kindnap. Another example, peoples in families use technology inapropiately causing get all on troubles and having less communication between them as human.

Secondly, some people prefer to talk in text message while they are driving. This is cause of many accidents peoples use devices in their car. Sometimes person does not even look who is begin stting next to them. The are some problems as someone told me. Generic_Name was driving with his mother who was in another country: She came to see him, but he did not left the phone alone and look at his back the computer after a two miles, they crash crossing a railroad. Also, we knows the risk of doing it. People think tha using technoly and have less communication with their family anywhere is safe, but they are wrong because one distraction for our limitation with others human can be deadly.

Thirdly, energy is anothers problem because people spend more money. Even know, this increase a lo of accidents because custome's companies just buy lof of thing as computer, cellphone, and toys. The problem is many peoples spend more time plugin in setting beside its divice charger to get some energy in their computer or cellphone. One more example in about this problems Generic_Name was addicted to the computer in his room. He was charging it. He was friendless because of this reason, and Generic_Name did not talk with his family as normally; however, he just say good bye everyday.

In conclusion, Everyone has to stop using technology for unimportant reaso or things. This will be more safe for you and your family. In ddition, limitation of human contact have more consecuences while you are with your family, driving, and spend more enery. It's your time to chane this word.

Some persons wants to finish carriers of schools, but they cant for this reasons.

- They does not have much time to do it,

because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that.

-Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

Taking classes at home wil be the better options for the studens which ones wants to conitinue their carrier after high school, into the university,becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier , and to get done what they wnats to be and their future ...

Some carriers are really expensives, and a parents cant pay for it. Well the students can work and get many. And the same time with this programs they can still continue with they classes .

Also begin home taking a classes, should be a better more consentration and relaxing eating an apple, least worrys and getting ready for a better future. Doing classes work and the free time and having time to do others staff.

Classes a distance, will be the better option for alot of peoples, they can have time to do many things done at the same time .

"You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new.",human

"More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.

So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.

You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.

You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong.

Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.

If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. ",human
"If we work together the more we learn. From partnership you can learn and hear what other people come up with. I chose partnership because of diccuse in groups, work in groups, and learn more.

First, discusing in groups is one thing that partnership is. If one person doesn't get something another person can come up with other ideas. If I came up with new ideas i can share my ideas with the group i'm in. People can also hear what another student can up with in their own ways. Students can also correct themselves if they messed up on a word.

Second, working in groups is another idea of working with partners. People can help one another if they are having trouble understanding something. I can also learn new things just by hearing what a student came up with. In a group we can also check each others paper to see what they came up with. We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence.

Third, by learning more we can get the hang of using that learn strategy. Coming up with new ideas to improve our writing. In group we can talk about each others paper if we think there should be a puncuation ore if a word is spelled wrong. If someone didn't puncuate a sentence correctly we can find a good puncuation to place it so that it would sound right. we acn also revise our paper to each other and hear what each others paper needs correction.

In conclusion, working in groups, learning more, and discuse in groups are reasons why i chose partnership. Working with partners brings new ideas in each others work.",human
"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on people's lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news.

Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents don't get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because it's on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesn't loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you don't know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language.

Some people lives in another country or states and it's hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You can't write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they can't meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at.

Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks it's fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology.

Most people like that technology is growing because it's better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABC's and 123's. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better.

Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . There's many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of people's live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also it's a good way to communicate with other people faster.  ",human
"Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.

A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.

In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.",human
"I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.

Everyone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them

However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... . I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you don't know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that you're like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.

Considerating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them.

In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. Doesn't matter what you can't act bad with other persons, even if you don't know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before.

"To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. By giving them more time to relax. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax,

to grow and achieve more, and to help others.

We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more.

Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they don't have time to do it. They are working Saturdays' and studying on Sundays'. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time.

Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I don't have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they don't have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world.

To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Students can have more time with their families,

to grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Which it is a great opportunity to both of them to achieve more. ",human
"I think reading would be a enjoyable educational activity because you might find a book very intresting to you and it will also help your brain better at reading. reading is fun and also educational but it all depends on the person because some people might not like reading they could like reading when they are adults. and the best thing about reading you can do it anywhere like at school,friends house,airport ext. some people are into alot of different genre's like comedy,or horror,drama,ext. i like reading diary of a wimpy kid,and comic's my favorite was diary of a wimpy kid dog days it was about a kid named greg getting his first dog and not knowing how hard it is to take care of it.

if you don't like reading alone their are some things called bookclubs if you don't know what they are they are a group of people friends,family ext and they read the same book as you and talk about it they tell predictions,summarys, if you are wondering where the bookclubs could be located in librarys or you can make your own wiyh your friends or family. and this is what i thinks is a enjoyable educational activity.",human

Working in Groups or Alone

In school sometimes we work in groups and sometimes we work alone. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment.

First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes.

Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas.

Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work don't will be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed.

In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed. Working in groups is a gift. ",human
"My opinion about conserve energy and resources.

I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.

I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.

My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.

Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.

My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.

My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",human
"I think seif-esteem come from praise, in my opinion, praising is good for student to built self-esteem by theirself.

expecially the praise come from their teacher, you know everyone like that other guys to praise him/her, i dont want to my parents criticize to me. even though common people, I care people's talk, Dosen't everybody care?

as a student, I understand that means in my mind, if I make some mistake, I know this is my fault early, when teacher criticize to me ,I will so sad, It isn't has a strong mind in everyone's heart, we are human not god, so don't bring blow to kid when he/ she get trouble. they are fragile, because they have different thought, more blame to others, more counter to you. you should try to encourge to them, say you are good, if student have some fault really, Don't say no ,should say:I think you can do it better.

It improtant to make progress when they are growing up. the great education is nurtured little by little early. I trust you can do it or blame them simply ,Let me compare and think about it. It's not in the same way.

You are distinctive! I really think that is truth. i admit you are right so long as you can say you understand by use your way. actually right or wrong is not improtant. but this is serious that you want to probe the problem of the learn is necessary, we can't blow them.

"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots.

Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.

Finally what are you waiting for!. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forgot your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greastest accomplisment.",human
"Principal

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement.

"If schools offers students distance learning as an option, that student should take the offer. That's my opinion if a school ever offer me online school. If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receive free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.",human

"People can learn without making mistakes. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important. People should not make their own decision. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.           ",human

"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I strongly agree. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually don't want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they don't try to please others.

Firstly, people become more confident. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because it's hard to get their words out. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Secondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them.

For example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. This is a major reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Lastly, people don't try to please others. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

As a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. you become more confident. you get the chance to be the real you. You do not try to please others. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness.

"Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects.             ",human
"Some people think that is a good idea, but actually it is not. I think we shoul keep folllowing the plan thatbis already planted by the goverment.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.

They don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", that's not the life that people want and that's not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders.

The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

In my conclusion: it's better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide what's really matter and what's matter to us.",human
"A poll by a student from San Antonio high school shows that 92% of people between 14-21 years have been influenced by others. Influencing others can be catastrophic or great but only a selected group of people chosen by the individual can do it. Humans are being influenced constantly by different people and ways of thinking, but he most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises from others and social stereotypes

Most adolescents are extremely insecure and need their friends's approval. Many times teens are challenged by their friends in order to do something that can cause fatalities or a great success. Generic_Name was a terrible student when he moved to Generic_City from Generic_City, but when he met Generic_Name his life changed because Generic_Name peer pressured him, taught him English and influenced on him to achieve success on Generic_Name's high school career.

Parents, siblings, friends and idols have the power of being able of influence on others by giving advises based on their own life experiences. Old people advises are the most effective because of their great wisdom and erudition. Generic_Name's grandfather was a well-known writer and gave many advises to Generic_Name about how to write good essays. after all that, Generic_Name has been awarded with different prices and many scholarships that required essays.

Every culture have different societal rules, but each rule can influence and shape anyone as a person. All personalities are different but most personalities are modified by cultural rules. When Generic_Name went to Dubai, she decided to wear a hijab although she was not Muslim because if she did not wear it, people would look at her with contempt, this shows how social. stereotypes can affect anyone.

The most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises and social stereotypes. If all humans were influenced by good people with good intentions, life would be easier, and there would never be a lack of good poeple trying to influence other on the way of success and saintliness.",human
"A Positive Mental Attitude by Generic_Name

A possitive mental attitude can make you successful but it can also blind you from seeing how you may fail. The idea of being successful in life has nothing to do with a positive attitude or negative attitude its how you struggle to try and be successful and not just say that you will be successful, a lot of people have wanted to try and be successful or try helping by being successful but also fail and their hardwork goes down the drain. You should think about working hard and being the best

YOU

that you can be, but yes you should still try to keep a positive attitude but also a negative attitude in case you need to keep up if you make a mistake. If i were to be the one saying this from trying. I have never been successful in anything

WITH

WITHOUT

the positve mental attitude its difficult to keep the positive attitude but you should keep that attitude and strive for success. I'll show you pros and cons now

Pros

Keeps your mind at bay

Helps in tough situations

People may be encouraged to help or stand by you for your attitude

Cons

A failure in what you do could make you depressed

Your anxiety may skyrocket and make you uneasy

Everything might seem hopeless

You might see yourself as a failure

People around you might move away from you because your attitude may change.

"Yes i agree with Churchill's statement about the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because we need to learn to not lose hope in what we want for success and our future. Imagine you keep on failing and failing but knowing your going to be successful in life? Imagine not losing fate or enthusiam to pursuit for success? That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam."" How would you know your going to fail to pursuit for success?

What is success? Success is to achieve goals you been wanting to accomplished. Everyone wants to accomplished something or anything. It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success. It's understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right. No one is perfect,it's understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it.

Everyone wants to be successful in life or in anything. For an example when you apply for a job you to apply first, then wait for a response for the interview,After when the interview is done you have to wait a couple days or two until they call you to notify you if you have gotten the position or not. Well thats how we feel when were trying pursuit for success hoping that we can do this and having fate to not give up.

When you know your failing to pursuit for success is when you keep making mistakes but you keep going until you get it right. No matter how many times you keep making mistakes it won't stop you from what you are doing or trying to get. You can be still successful no matter how much you fail because it will make you smater for success.

Success is something that many have achieved or have not but at the end of the day were resposiable for any mistakes,actions and verbal language that we have used,It could affected anyone or anywhere. As we as people must continue on to be motavated for success if not someone else will speak up and take charge.         ",human
"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a student's work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a student's work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better.

First reason, When a student's work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A student's work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into.

Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a student's work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence.

Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education.

Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a student's work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a student's work.

"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do. It is like when someone ask a child, "" what do you want to be when you become an adult"".            ",human
"Explain how small acts of kindness can have a impact on others?

Did you know that if you pick up trash out of your way or someone else way you can actually help them think about why did they not pick up trash. Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality?

You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him don't just answer ""I don't know"" if you actually don't know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about.

Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they don't any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn.

kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone.

In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",human

In my opinion I think it would be bad for them If teenagers stay until after 10 p. m and not having a curfew, so it is good for them to have it because of these three examples.

If this was a law I think it would be good for them to have the curfew because they will have a time limit and they'll know what time to not go outside, because if the stay outside until after 10 p. m they are basically breaking the law.

I think it will be good for them because if they don't have it it will interfere their lives and their life schedule. And it will make them and keep them unorganized about everything. Because they can't sleep well, they won't have enough energy to keep up with their daily works.

In my opinion it will be good for them to have it because, it would be more safe for them and they will be more safe and it will keep them away from danger and trouble. Because they will know that after 10 p. m it might not be safe for them.

In conclusion it is good for the teenagers to have a time limit or a curfew for them to go outside. Because it will keep them safe and out of trouble. And it will make them and keep them organized. And the point is that if it was a law. It would've be better for them.

These are my three reasons to , why it's good for the teenagers to have a curfew and make them a time limit for them to go outside.",human
"There are people who are not happy with the career path they took. People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that.

Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening.

With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs.

Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.",human
"Do you image a Middle School student being in you classroom and telling you what you shouldnt do so you dont get introble I you future at school. Have you ever though what you can do to stay out of trouble in school? You might always have that one friend that gets introble a lot right? Ways you can prevent that from being you is try to prevent from getting into a fights that would just make it a bad idea, if you know someone that is doing what they are not so post to tell a teacher, dont make a poor choice and you get introble because you decided that you were going to do something that your friends wanted you to do.

When you get into a fight in school the only thing that that will do to you is get you into in school suspension or you would get suspended from school for a while. You dont want to get in school suspended that would just get you in a room with a teacher and you are not going to be able to talk to anyone. If I were you and I knew that some one wants to get into a fight I would ell the teacher and let them handle it not you. Another thing that if you do while there is a fight at your school and you record it you could get in trouble by that as well.

If you know something is wrong with a friend and they need help from an adult I would tell a teacher at school that can help them or there parents if you know them. If you try to help a friend by talking to the person that made your friend feel upset you could feel a friends mom or some adult you know close to your family.

When you made a poor choice it could get you in a lot of trouble when you are hanging around with friends and they want to do something thats not a good choice you could talk to them and tell them that is not going to be a good idea. A lot of times when kids make a poor choice they would have to face the consequences and they may not like them but they should of thought the things two times before they made there design.

There are so many different ways that you can stay our of trouble but theses three are the most common ones that i know of try not to get into a fight, help out your friends or tell an adult if they need help from some one, and dont make poor choices.",human
"Should people make there own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Some people will say it's your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime it's better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad. If you don't know what you want to be in life then you can think about things you like or get help from someone that you know that had that career. There is always going to be someone to go to for help even though people will say it's better to work by your self because you will not make any mistakes but we all make mistakes.

She told Generic_Name she will come to the school and talk to the principal and we can end this so she came to the school and talked to Generic_Name's principal about it they called Generic_Name and Generic_Name so they can talk about this Generic_Name said ""he only did that because he wanted to be friends with Generic_Name and get help in class but did't know how"" so Generic_Name said "" sorry"" and they both became friends and Generic_Name even help Generic_Name with work.

"I think we accomplish if we are always doing something, because it will help you to learn more things, we have to always stay busy doing something if we want to achieve. Doing anything will not help you if you want to be someone in the life. One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind.

Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it.

Another example is if you will have a test and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself.

In conclusion if we want to be a successful person, we never have to be idle, and we have to always stay busy doing something, always be positive, see the potential you have and feel able to do everything you want, and never be inactive, you have to be an active person to reach your goals. Also you have to believe in yourself and take off negative persons of your life.",human
"People think sometimes that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said,  Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing.

First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it.

Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it.

On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. In addiction, my mom is someone that consider as an example for me, if she do soemthing wrong it doesn't mean that I am going to do it, too. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong.

In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. It could be you influencing someone else or someone influcing you.",human
"The past decades technology has been advancing and helping humans to achieve goals that looked hard to accomplish. Although some people say that technology have a negative effect on peoples lives because technology is making people to not socialize, actually technology helps the people to communicate with others that are far away and technology makes people's lives easier.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on people's lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media.

However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

Also, technology makes people's lives easier because you can shop via internet, complete your work, and plan projects. Technology gives people an advantage to have an life without stress. In other works technology helps people to have better life. Thanks to technology we have the access to success in our lives.

In conclusion, Technology helps us all to have a better life and to have better communication with people we dont often see. dont you agree that technology makes our lives easier?

"Hi, my name is Generic_Name, nice to meet you.

I was looking for a job, and i see that here are hidding so, today i'm here because i think im a good candidate for this job, this job is really insterasting for me, and when i see it for the first time it attracks me, because i really like this kinda jobs, and i think that if you like your job you're gonna enjoy it, you also gonna take care about it, and you just gonna appreciate.

I'm also think did i have the characteritics that you are looking for, and when i see at the first i just realize the characteristics did i need to be hired, and i pretty sure did i get them, just with one exemption i need to get experience because i don't have any on this type of job's but, i am that type of person who learn really easily, im pretty sure did i can do this work, i'm also are a responsible person and i always make sure that my work is well done and always try to make as much i can, i'm also responsible to came all days at time, because i know that is really important to be a good employee.

I'm also respect my work mates, because i think that the work environment is gonna be really good if all us respect each other, preventing disagreements between us.

i'm also that type of person who try to stay away of the problems, i always try to prevent them, because i know how bad they can be, for example: Get me on trouble in my work, with my frinds, or with my work mates too, so i just try to stay away as much i can.

"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesn't have any saying in your life, if you don't want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right.

The first reason is that its okay if you don't want the other person's help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didn't want any, because she don't want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still don't want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me.

The second reason is people don't have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesn't want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and that's good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us.

Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example I'm 18 years ago, and i'm still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but i'm scared at no matter what i'm still feeling down with stuff. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. And i'm happy, so yeah thats good for me.

So basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU. So its good to get some advice and wisdom from others. even though you don't want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.",human
"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

"The Character of beyone my control it take influence to make it right. This prompt support that i am able to have my own character. The british naturalist is right because people make bad chooice sometime it dosen't mean they are bad. My character will show that how much i can do the right thing. Influence beyond control your mind but it mean you have to strong and kind to other. I control myself to do bad and good things i can only control me and my action that can be a issue. I make misstake and l can learn from my own mistack that are right. This is also supports how i act to other and be truth to myself. Sometime you don't have to be selfish but their many selfish human being that do the wrong things and they know what they doing even that were wrong.

If i really things about that what is my character i'll able to said that i am not perfact but i do the right things and i care about other people feeling may hurt by me and action and influence that i can control myself to not make misstakes that i'll regrade later. i support that my character is influence because i control myself and the rest of is you body do the rest in science that are study knowledge about human body but it's nothing to do with this but your character tell you how to choose and be youself. Sometimes i am not proude of who i am but it's not about who you are it about what you do and and what you said. I can control myself to do the right thing and their many teenager that dosen't know how to be yourself because it takes lots of controling your character. Your character tell you to support your respond to other that you choose away you can control yourself. My character will show that how much i can control myself to be myself and not to be the person that other want me to be. I can't give up i have to be postivie to myself and other and not to things nagative went i have to thing postivie to myself. I do agree with this quote because my character will be what i can just be myself and choose the right thing to make it right. My character makes me who i am now even went i wasn't my self. My pass what make me more strong and to be brave to control my self to choose make it all the way. It wasn't easy i work really heard to be the person that i am now my jerueny the reasons that i know how to be able to controling my self. Life isn't easy to know everything you have to thougt your self to live in this world there many people even don't know what is to be able to love yourself and do the right thing. The Britesh naturalist and politician and John Lubbock wrote this quote and i do believe that i can control what i said and i also control what are my action are that not usless to me because it's importan to me by influence beyond control take a position on this issue. For example i did losed control went i am not thinking postivie and choosing to be nagative that's why people need to know how to be able to control them self. Thinking postivie is't force it's come by influences and the people you around with not always the you round with their know how to control them sefl but it is not them that you can't depond on you have to learn your own and not all people are bad to hanging out with. I believe that one person can change the whold world just by their bravery and thinking postivie to them self i may not be prefact but i know how to control myself just by thinking postivie and think before i said or do anythigs. Some teen that are don't know how to control them self but you really don't have to know how to control your self they're many reasons influence that control youe self that you don't have control over what you have is you control you i know went i frist nocite that i have to make everything right but it is not what i have change it is what i am. Character influence beyond and it takes many reasons to be able to do the right thing i support that influence do control our character that we have and it make it more hearder to believe that i know what is the right and wrong thing as the time goes but my responds has to be the same i can't not change what other people do or said but what i can do is just be myself and think postivie that what makes it my character right. Character formed by influence beyond my control i do have many ressons to support this prompt do i choose my own character formed that is real by influences beyond control that i have over myself is my action and my thoughts that able to do the right thing as my character choose to be make it right. John Lubbock was right i do control my character formed by influences beyond that my brain tells me to do. it is positible to my character will be what me and myself choose to make it right, my responds with this prompt that is i can control my character will be show as i think postivie and do the right thing to improve my self that i can control my to be make it thru all the way as i'm useing character formed by influences beyond.

"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.

First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.

Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.

Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.

In conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. ",human
"Many schools are agree that students can finish high school in three years. Many students think that is a good idea to finish high school in three years. Some students think that they are waste time in four years in high school. In my opinion is a good idea to finish high school in three years, because the students can take class before school or after school, then, they can graduate in three years instead four years, instead elective courses, the students can take class, they need for graduate, and the students will have more time to go to college.

The students can take class before school or after school, and they can graduate in three years instead four years. The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school.

Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college. If the students finish high school in three years, they will go early to the college.

The students will have more time to study in college. The students will have time to think, what they want to study in college. Also, the students can finish very early their career. However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go.

I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers. If, them finish two career, they will have a lot of opportunities to get a good job, and have a good pay.",human
"The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,"" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway.

I'm disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people.

To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. that's why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they can't do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture.

If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and don't peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work.

The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is do what you thing is right; and the comunty need to have a good relationship families,neightborhood, and students.    ",human
"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate people's characters, and makes them good in their own way.

Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of people's characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older.

People's environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that person's character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him let's go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character.

Culture has a big impact on a person's character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the person's character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture.

In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. People's character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a person's character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other. This is a very important topic and it means a lot to me and other people Thank You for giving me the change to talk about it.       ",human
"Technology

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. We need cost more time. It is not a good things for us. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us.

People do not need contact work together. It save many time and improve the work. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.",human
"Technology allows people to work in an easy way, technology helps to connect people from different parts of the world. Also technology works as entertainment for kids and old people . Technology has affects in our life is basically something that we need everyday or something that we cannot live without it because is really important

Fist, Technology connect with a lot people around the world, different web sites get money making app that people can text, call or make a meet with people that they do not know. As a student technology helps me all the time doing my homework or learn about different cultures, connect with my friends.

Second, as a young lady I use Facebook, Snapchat, instagram, photo editor, online books, etc a lot of this apps that technology give us, my life is easier with technology. When I was a kid my family decided to move a different country it was new for me I thought that I never will see my friends and family there I cried in all our travel because I miss the people in my country I did know anything about technology, I grew up I have my cellphone, laptop and table, I can make video call with them and see them, last Sunday I made a video call with my grandmother, is really incredible everything that we can make with technology, I still missing them but at least we can talk everyday.

Third, technology effects positive in people lives, think for a moments our life without technology, how hard life or boring, technology is. At this time our life depends of technology, millions people using everyday different apps for work, studies or just for fun.

Conclusion, technology is part of the world that we live, it makes our life easier and connect with different thing or people use it for good things and be successful on things that technology give us.",human
"It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . Although some say working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast.

Some say that working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Name's house. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. All I can say, we all just waste our time.

However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. It is true that many heads think better than one because if one comes with an idea then all together discuss about it. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Working alone doesn't help in answering doubt that we could have.

Also, working with a group is a great benefit because we can work fast. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts.

Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate.

In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work. Thank you for taking your time to read my paper, I hope you understand why I prefer working with a group.",human
"School should add one and a half hour to school each day. because student will get to learn more,student can get more help from teachers,also student can do more sports.

First of all,student will learn more if school board add one and a half hour to their school day. probably student will learn more because their classes will be extended. Also they can get more time in each class,so they can get more information and learn more about each subject. Also they will have the opportunity to do more activity in class. And learn how to work with others. And listen to different opinions and get to a conclusion,For example if some student are good in a activity and others are not that good. They can have the time to work as a group and explained what they are good at and what they need more help, so they all can help each other. They will also have time to work by them self. And passing there SOL.

Secondly, student can get more help from teachers. It will benefit all the student in the school, because some student need more help and different subjects. So they can have the time to go to their teachers and get some help. for example some student needs help in Math,English,civic etc. But some student are better in that subjects. So they can used one and a half hour to do another period. In that period student can go to the classes that they need more help. It will be better for some student because each student are different. And learn in a different ways . It does not mean that others are smart. It means that some student learn better in small groups. Some student learn more faster than others. Extending school it will help them get their grades up,By retaking quizzes and test and finish unfinished work. they can get help in homework too because homework is like practice,they can practice what they learn in class and get a better score in quizzes and tests

Finally,student can have the time to do more sports. With some of their schoolmates. They can have different sports. For example soccer,basketball,baseball,kickball and more sports..Student can make a vote, for what sports they will like to be in. They can learn new skills and get better by playing that sport. and get more healthy because they are playing a sport. because a big percent of student used a lot of their technology at home and don't do any sports. By extending school it can motive them,by doing some sports with their friends. They can play a lot of sports and see which sport they prefer to play,and see in which sport they are good at. They can do more activity for example Art, photographing for people that like to be creative.

In conclusion extending school it will benefit student in different ways. for example getting help from their teacher so they can get better in that subject and get good grades,Getting more time in class,They can get more information. Finally playing sports,they can be healthy and have a hobby that they like to do after all the information that they had learn during the day,some people like to do different activity like Art photographing.

"Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement.

They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder.

This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve.

This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished.

Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger.

Also achievement helps you praise yourself.

What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things.

Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals.

It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good.

So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself.

Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction.

For example, you have jsut achieved a goal you've had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it.

Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up.

satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself.

Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key.                   ",human
"Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .

Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .

Committing to career

When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,

because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.

Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.

Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.

But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people. Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well

.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.",human
"School required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.

All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.

Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.

Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.

People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.

While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project.        ",human
"The one person that has shared wisdom and experience with me is my friend, Generic_Name. Learning or sharing wisdom and experience with her have taught me a lot of thing that is around the environment. The benefit of learning experience from people is because it help to make the right choice, help to know activities more easily, and also it help people to be strong.

Making the right choice is not something that everyone are able to do on their own. The experience and wisdom learned form people can help to know the mistake that have been done which will help them to prevent it form happening. It helps with learning from other failed experience in life which also help to bring the best out in making that right choice in life today.

People doing thing and knowing activities more quickly other it because they have more wisdom and experience for a long time or they have notice the activities form someone they know in their life time. Having the experience of knowing thing easily can happen in both in school or at the work place. It helps them to move forward with others that are high than moving backward.

It also help people to be strong in so many ways by giving them some encouragement that they can be better than what they were before. It also gives hope to a lot of people in today's life. Experience and wisdom can easily help people that are not too great in doing thing outside their home and also make them to the top of their school or their work.

In conclusion, learning wisdom and experience can be very helpful in people life today. Experience can help give them power that they can be better than what they were and also learning for people's mistakes so that they can prevent it from happening .                         ",human
"It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know.

I think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Life gets irritating. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. We are always looking for something new. We never reach complete satisfaction. It is part of our nature, curiosity.

Even the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth.

Limiting what you do, causes you to shrink. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). Limitation in most cases is not a good thing.

Sure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like.

Doing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. We should always be going after growth.",human
"Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies.

"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more.

One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and don't distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.

Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.

Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.

The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.",human

The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change.

First impressions can hurt people's feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings.

Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change.

Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big.

Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.                          ",human
"I am not agree with those educators that say, the summer break is too long and the students can't retain imformation as easily when they return in the fall. The summer break is made to a students's benefit, it help the students as a relajation during the summer. The students have to spend time with their family a lot as possible they can. Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. That is why I am not agree the educators that does't wants the summer break long.

One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the school's work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a school's stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the school's time the students does't have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the school's year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the school's work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Finally, the student does't need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it would't be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.",human
"Cna you imagine how good it feels to live by choosing your best character? Choosing our own character for ourself will never make us regrate it in the future.

People choose theire own character because, they know that theire choice will make them win at the end. When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. But nothing comes in an easy way if you want the reall succesful ,we need to follow our character.

Whenever we choose our own character, we have the confidence to do on what we are planing to do. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing.

As long as we know our charachter, we will always have the right chocie to make, because we know what is going to match with our character or with our wantings. Sometimes when we are planing to get married, we do not just guess to match with our parteners ,but we choose our character to match with our partner's character, that is because we know that we can choose our character in any how that makes us feel the best way to our living. Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your partener's character, and that is why we should choose our own character.

A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. Or they can learn from what thier teacher teaches them, and we all know that our teachers are always willing to teach us the best behaviour and that is why the most students start to choose thiere character at school.

.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character. You can not pretend to be the character that you do not choose to be, that is just like living a fake life. Life is easier and happier when we follow our own rules. Let's follow our character that we choose to be, no matter what!!. ",human
"I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take,for example if a student wants to take a music class as a elective they,ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don,t need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous.

Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective .

Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

"Do you agree or disagree with extending the school day? Many students said that it's good for them to finish homework at school, but some of students disagree this idea. I disagree with expending the school day, I think it's not good for us.

First ,every student have something they like to do, so students can join a club or an activity after school. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up. In the winter ,the sun sets up so early, the day is short, it's too dangerous for the students who walk home.

Second, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. It's quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well,they need more time to study. So, I think it's not good to expend the school day.

Lastly, if the school board will not expend the school day, it can not only help us do what we want to do for a long time ,but also let us have a long and good sleep. We have a lot of homework in the high school, we may finish homework late. It's not good for students. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day. If they do not sleep very well at night, they will not have good mentality to study next day, their grades may decline.

These are my reasons, I disagree to expend the school day. I think my idea can help the school board to make the decision.",human
"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief. Also, by being patience on making important decisions, since, everything takes time. And, do not be afraid on doing what you love because it brings you to the way to be success.",human
"I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, because is important to be a yourself in the world for the example, in my case is very cool be writer is constantly trying in the world. In th worl needs people like auhors.

In the world needs very much people where exist much writers, and having books for to read, all needs books about the inspirations like people, for example like be yourself is luris be unique.

I want to be someone else they don't like to much think in yourself just what they want.

In the else of the jobs, if you try to be yourself and the built the company want you will never fine the happen to me a lot of time, when try to apply to a job they want you altogether with different expresion like: Happy, active, team work, and accurate.

I agree too with Ralph Waldo Emerson with this theme ""to be yourself in a world is constanly triying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment.""

This theme is for to learn much are sentences small but is interesting are word for go ahead, for demontrate a good energy a all person that feeling of be yourself is a theme muy interesting like my person is a segment that transmit securiy, and joy in we soul.

is like for example that persons that feel less than that other person this is a agurmen or texbook like this transmit good vibes a that person.

Exist person that don't like understand because they don't care this theme they want cell phone, video game, and all insignificant over there take a very bad conduct the person having that to read, to learn, to listen, to silence, after to know they have to help and counsel.

The life is a circle when all people have to learn, to living, of good form.                                                 ",human
"The first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree about that, cause me personal i don't have issues with no one around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out.                ",human
"Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"".

I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.

The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:

In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.

For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.

In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.

In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.

In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.

Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.

In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm.",human
"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.

One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.

Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.

Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.",human
"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.",human
"Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. I believe that people should take other peoples' guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices.

What is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters.

Why should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. Maybe it will lead them to build something amazing, start their brand company. Just something between those lines. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. I've had so many people bring me down on how I'am going to never make it the Army branch. I'm just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. Even though they making money that not my passion. My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. One of his saying was ""yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery"".

In conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind. All I'am just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do.

"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. ",human
"Working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace and we all have different levels, in that case we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas. Although other may think working with a group is better and more beneficial.

Also, working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace. Working at your own pace is very important, you will not make mistakes and if you do it is totally fine because that is where we learn from. You may be the type of person that likes working little by little every night instead of doing it all at once. You will not have people over your house horse playing instead of helping you out and working with you on your project. When working alone you do not have to worry about all these concerns because you will be the only responsible one for your own work.

Working alone is more beneficial and can be very helping, it will prepare you for the real world. When working alone you may write or put what you think is correct, your friends will not be there to tell you that you are incorrect. You might be a independent person and prefer to work by yourself. You do not have to worry about someone rushing you because you should know when the due date is. While working alone you just have to worry about you, and finishing your work of course.

Although, others may think it is more beneficial working with a group. Working with a group can bring a lot of distractions. Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

Does it not feel much better working alone? You can work at your own pace and we all do not have the same mentality, so we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas and what you think is correct. Let me tell you a little secret, working with a group can be pretty complicated. Always working alone, it is more beneficial.        ",human
"I agree because there might be some kids out there who say that they want shorter school time and maybe some don't want that but i think there should be shorter school time. The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv. And theres places that you can learn math too.

The reasons of why i think its fair for having shorter school time is because sometimes you learn something that you've learned already and in the other hand its just not fun anymore either i mean for some other kids they think its fun and some not. And also i've seen on twitter that they been hating on the guy who tells us if school is closed or not and people always hope that school is closed because no one is really looking foward to go to school on a monday and my opinion going to school on a monday is the worst and some other people might think the same as well.

Some celebreties became famouse for example Eminem who is a rapper he dropped out of highschool and he became famouse for something that he likes to do i would do the same if i didn't what to go to highschool but i wont because i have really good friends and all the years i've known them i just can't leave them like that.

I guess it just wont be fair y'know to leave someone you've known for awhile and just become famouse and while there in school working hard.

I guess we could all agree that we should have shorter school time because what if your doing something and you don't get to finish your project or something important you'll have to wait intill you get out of school and then come back and what if theres traffic and then you get home around 8:30 to 9:00. You wont have that much time to finish your project but if you live close to the school then i can't complain but i agree to this because like how i said we have phones,computers,and TV's and on the internet you could learn anything you want for an example you could learn about 10th grade stuff even though your an 8th grader maybe your interested in that.

My point here is that we should have shorter school time because nowadays we could learn by ourselfs and for the preschool kids and kindergarden kids they should stay there a little longer because they are toddlers and they can't learn anything by them selfs but for us we should i have shorter time in school hopefully you could understand. I don't want this to effect anyone but like it'll just make all the kids who go to school have more time when they have to do something important instead of coming home late and barely have anytime to finish there project or anything they need to do but thats my point of view.

"When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.

In conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do.      ",human
"Dear Principal:

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says "" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport. Their is a lot of students in SCHOOL_NAME that don't have good grades and cant participate i",human
"Technology has a lot of the positive and negative side to it. In the positive side technology comes in handy a lot you can shop online , pay a lot of your bills online and do a whole lot. In the negative side you loose contacts with humans cause every person abuses technology , people always on their phones , people losing eye to eye conversion with each other.

technology will always have a good or bad side in way how humans use it.

In the positive way of technology , a lot people use technology to shop online , a lot of times people try to find the products that he or she wants to find in the store and its to expensive to buy in store , people find it more cheaper products online than outlet stores. Not only people shop online, people also use technology to buy programs that colleges recamend them to use. It helps a lot of people that are in college that do a lot of homework a lot teachers assign homework online than paper. technology always advance everyday in a good way to enjoy. A lot of high school students use technology to do homework for a class that the students miss that day he or she was absent.

technology keeps everyone in check and organized. But yet even if theres a lot of positive stuff about it ,

there's a lot negative things about technology.

In the negative part of technology ,

a lot people thats on their phone ignores the person that he or she was having a conversation with.

The main big problem right now is that people are abusing technology by texting and driving while using their phones , a lot of people are getting distracted on the road cause they want to answer their text message but most of the time people that answer gets into a car crash for getting distracted.

Theres always gonna be a bad and good ways about technology it all depends how humans use technology.

The way I see people using technology its good cause it a lot easier to organize important documents , shop online , doing homework for school and everyday technology will always advance each day.

The only problem thats bad about technology its that us humans getting distracted easily by using our phones , playing games on console , and getting distracted easily. Theres always gonna be a bad and good towards technology it all the depends how humans use it.

Technology is the best thing we have in our world. It makes life more easier for us to do stuff online. Technology will be there for us when we need it to organize documents , buy stuff online , and it will always advance. technology will always have a positive and negative side to it but most of the time its positive. it all depend how humans use it. thats what I think about my side technology the bad and the good.

"I think that it's a bad idea to put more hours of school beacause after school people,students and teachers have to do important stuff like take there kids to soccer or go to a doctors appointment and thats the only time that we have free to do are important missions and there are teacher's that live far they could live in Generic_City and other places that are far. And if we make it longer there are going to be parent's that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and it's like 5pm-6pm it's stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you can't to beacause they put more time in School.

And i think it sucks beacause there are kids that go to my school that live in Generic_City and it take along time to come to school and go back home from school beacause i've lived in Generic_City before and it suck when i stay after school i get home like at 7pm-8pm and it's sucks so it better to not make school longer beacause there are kid that live pretty far and there are going to get home late and then they have to get there homework done too. so it's dummy hard work to get that on time. And us as chidren its going to ruined are shecdule and are parent's to maybe we have not go to soccer or any activity that we take just beacause they put more time in school it going to suck being in a class room for 80 mintues now. it's to be trieding.

They meant if we get a half an hour of more school they start giving us more homework then we mostly get and doing that for just 3 hours that we get just beacause they want to add more time it's going to be hard for everybody and they teacher if they live far it's going to be hard beacause at 6pm thats when all rush hour are so much traffic and there going to come home late and when they come home late there going to be grading work and then waking up at 5pm to go back to work and that trieding doing that smae rountine for there whole life it hard I dont even go to work and i'm like wow if that happens it going to be bad.

Another thing that why would should have on more half an hour is beacause we wake up early and have another half hour kicking ints not far if they want to do that they should a least change they school time and wake up like at 8am or something beacuase its not far wake up early and then leaving so late it should be the oppsite wake up late and leave school early it going to be better beacause then everybody going to kbe happeir no one is going to be in a bad mood and it's going to be chill and then .

Anothe thing way we should have an half an hour of school left it's beacause we the 8th grader we get lunch at 1:40 and then haveand half and hour of school were going to have lunch at 2:10 or something I arleadly hate that and i dont wanna be starving beacause then i wont to my work beacause how hungry I i'm going to get mad i'm going to get hangry and having busdriver taking the kid home at 6pm its going to suck beacause they need there time too for they could do stuff and have time with there family's and there going back and forth it sucks for them having ti puck up kids late and stuff and taking them home.",human
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""To be yourself in the world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Currently your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is a act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility,the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you.

First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter it's no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you

Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person.

Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc.

In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.",human
"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

"What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it.    ",human
"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits.

One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game.

Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.

Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school.

"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        ",human
"Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years?

Four years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years you do a lot of things you can participate in many activities. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. The school will help you in life to know how to act and guide you in what is better and you get a better life with school.

School should be just 3 years instead of four. In four years the student learn more, but I don't think is necessary to be in the school all that time. Three years of high school is a challenge. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. If the student want to success in life it doesn't matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals.

I am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs. high school is hard but not impossible to finish, and is a good idea to push the students to graduate before, there are better opportunities and the only thing that I think when someone is telling me that I have to be more time in the school is ""I'll be old when I'll finish the school"" and that doesn't sound good. It's better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect.

Most of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they don't want to end when they get old. That's why I like the idea. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. Plus, you have better opportunities and also you don't waste your time.

Even four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. Four years Is good but not all the students like to do the same thing in that time and they get bored. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make. ",human
"Some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Others think that inactivity also serves a purpose. They argue that they are not focus and they are not learning. One should always accomplish a goal if one puts their mind to it. they gain new knowledge,skills, and information.

If one has the knowledge he can accomplish anything. I wanted to learn how to make a dog house. I had no knowledge on how to build a dog house. My friend had told me that the school was having a science fair and that they were giving knowledge on how to build a dog house. I went and I had got the knowledge that i needed. I had the knowledge to stat it and to finish it. The dog house came out looking pretty good with the help of knowledge that I had. If one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has the skills to accomplish a goal he can can do anything. When i was in school I wanted to improve my skills in English. I would ask mt teacher to give me tips on what I needed to improve. She would tell me me not to use the word you. By the end of the year I was not using the word you. She had told me that my English skills were improving because I had been working on it all year. She told me that i was a strong writer. If one has the knowledge, skills , and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has information he can accomplish any goal in his way. When i was in high school I wanted to take welding as a class. I had no information on how to join the class. I asked my friend on how i could join he told me that I had to go to the office to get the information that I needed. With the information that I got I now had to fill it out so that I could join the class next year. if one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If everybody in the community had the Knowledge ,skills, and the information then everybody would accomplish a goal. Although others think that they should not be focused on accomplishing a goal. One should have theses skills so that they can accomplish anything that they want.         ",human

If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people should't have rolemodle just don't do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he did't play in high school he did't like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.

Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.

Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life.",human
"Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax.

Also when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years.

We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments. Finally it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year.",human
"I think that imagination is not more important then knowledge, so I disagree with this statement that Albert Einstein made. It know for a fact that I use knowledge more than imagination.

Some reasons why i disagree are if you don't know anything you cant imagine anything. You might be asking your self why? But the simple answer is that if you don't know anything, you also won't know what to imagine. Without knowledge you can't imagine and create or do stuff.

Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed. I know that if I got burned because I sipped from o mug full of hot coffee, I would not sip from it again until it cools down because I have experienced the burn.

My last reason is that, sometimes when i use my imagination, I use it to create or do something and make it creative. But you can't make it creative if you dont know what creative you are looking for. One example is when i had to make my name out of macaroni and cheese.

That was my reasons and what I think, what do you think? In conclusion I disagree because its just obvious to me that knowledge is more important than imagination. Do you agree or disagre with me?",human
"I agree with this prompt many cases it is impossible say the people but i will tell you something we can, many peoples says is impossible to change the world, and you know what we can is something is on our head that keeps blocking, i think it is our priority number one, change the world, change our vision of watch our environment,

the people needs to change to see the real thing that is happening on our environment, change one little thing is a big change does not matter what but the change began, i would say among the world and our life, do you think our life are safe i say no because the global warning it is on us, and we can change it of course, the thing is nobody it is gonna get up until someone do, what we have been doing is not wright, the change is coming. We have been doing a lot of work every day and you know what for global warning, know let's talk about the people many peoples say can't change them self because is hard, it is impossible, no one will see change on my, and many other thing but peoples need to change their behavior, among the day peoples feels tired because they had bad day or they do many work. but i will never give up because as the tree can change the leaf to another color i can change the world one thing i can change myself but we can change it as a team with many other peoples, is better together than alone the change will even bigger and bring many others countries and join us, if i can change myself i can change another peoples to see the real life in what we live. I want to talk about me i really want to change myself because many other peoples needs me to help them be courteous, kind, responsible, on time and try to do better on what i do, change myself and the life of peoples it is my priority number one, if i know what is write and what is wrong i know what i gonna do change the impossible to possible nothing is this world is perfect nobody but we have to support other in what they need, we have to be happy of our self from the right thing we have been doing and up coming. I like technology and electricity those are the to matter i want to study with technology i would like to build a personal robot because everybody wants one and help in the day with the task of the home i know that will cause dangerous because can damage itself with an update or make it crazy but that can change the life yes everybody will be happy and peoples can rest better, with the electricity i would like to do the first smart phone that can charge with the sun because can not be generate a lot of energy. Is never too late you can make many thing as you can but if you make it you are right is not wrong make mistake i can tell you one thing is good because you can learn from them if you never make mistake you are wrong the mistake are the key to successful to change the bad thing to the right. You are my passion to live my mom say and you can change the world or may be not because in your head there is your world where you can build many thing to help peoples maybe you can not build a big change but one little thing is more bigger that i big thing, the change is coming very soon around the corner. but the change is not enough many peoples think the opposite and they never will change their minds that the bad thing are right and is very sad see peoples thinking about it they need to open their eyes and see what is really happening around their environment. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change this prompt is easy to understand because in the actuality there are many impressions that can never change of course others can do it but not a lot will be agree, sometimes i don't know what to write i write what i see, i heard, and touch my experiences to change are really small but the dreams come true sometimes not in the real life but in your head yes if i could dream a big dream to change world and the life for the peoples who need a little help to make their dreams come true and they always will say thanks because you change my whole life and others now is is my turn to change other you did your part now i have to do my part thank you very much. The behavior in the school, in the house, in the community, in the country, in the neighborhood, and with the peoples who you talk those are part of the change, something ugly to something beautiful the change we have to bring it from the house and the teachers are those who change our self from the way to study and get a better future, The most part of everything is get started if we don't do that nobody is gonna get up until i make the first right thing, my teacher say it is important change the way thing are build and get the point you want it, i love the way i think to change anything but i need some extra help many cases i say if i could do one thing is make something like a video or video animation and upload to the social media will be great because many peoples will see the video and they are gonna say this is what i want it, this is what i was looking for and the hole word will see it, i like many others prompt but this is not difficult to say something nothing is impossible everything is possible if you never give up everything is gonna be right and the change you are gonna do is going to be the one of many peoples will be proud of you all, and i am going to finish with this last word, everything you think is wright is write if is the opposite you are right as well just never give up and continue strait, may be if every people can think and put the most of his part will be great at this point you change it, and i will tell you because you already have been change the bad thing to the right the only thing is wait until the process is complete, i make mistakes and you too and we know if we fixed we can change what you want and the make it possible the life is passing too fast and we have to live it like is the last day of our life and never give up. i will try my best the change is near to you.",human
"In most student's summer time,they learn different things from their break,such as work experience,new knowledge from a book,and tradition about other country;In this cause,teacher's designed is not a good choices for student's project,because teacher can not make suitable choices for students,so the way can help students more understand about what they can do in the summer project is student's designed.

When the summer break start,student can make a lot choices about their plan in the summer,for example,they can stay home,travel to somewhere,or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different,they learn different things from their break,teacher could not really know what happen in student's break,this is why student need designed their own title.

In half way of the summer,some student might not even start making their project,in this cause if teacher give student a hard title,such as""after you read this book,what your opinion and what you learn from this book?"",then student have try rush through the book,and start making a project,it will make student have a bad project content,if student can decide they own project title,such as""base on your break,what you learn from your travel,it can be anywhere"",if student can create their own project title,it will be a lot interesting and easy.

Most student want to learn a new things from interesting activity,and spend a time on those things,and student always know what whey like to do,they can create title base on animals,vehicles,or their life experience,it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve,if they can decide their own project title.

Between teacher's designed and student's designed,student always like to make their own choices,they can learn things from activity they are interesting,talk and share experience with their friends,and have a easy project in their summer time,that's why student's designed better then teacher's designed.",human
"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations.",human
"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",human
"Establishing a homework club would be a great idea because students can get help. Another reason this is useful to student is because they could finish all her/his work and get more time to do what they want at home. Lastly It gives them an chance to learn more.

Students can get help in a homework club easily. One way they can get help is by asking a teacher for help. Another way a student can get help is asking a friend for help. They can get help with a teacher and a friend. This is how students can get help easily.

Students can finish there work at school. When they finish there work at school they got more time to do whatever they want. They could play games. They could read a book. they could take frequent naps. In conclusion people can do more things when there done with there work.

This gives them a chance to learn more because they can ask more questions and get there work done.

In conclusion they should establish a homework club for the people that need help. Also for the people that want to finish there homework. Thats why they should establish homework club",human
"I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling wether you know them for long. Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you dont have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did. ",human
"The technology has improve this years, allows people to makes think much faster than before and the technology every day its going to keep improving. I think that Technology makes thighs more easy for everyone but especially for does that cant walk, speak or heard. Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

Technology is very important this days, for everyone but if we used for good because their is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to used because it can helps us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good.",human
"Many people believe that success consists of going from failure. because we all human making mistake in our life. being faliure is good for must of peoples. however we all taking lesson from faliure to faliure to be come success in our life. for many resons: fristly,must of students, agree with this statement that Minister Winston Churchill once said. and secondary, part of students did not believe in this statement. however they are thanking we do not want to failure in our life or tests. we want to success once time. previosly must of people agree failure is key is success.

for example: Abraham Lincoln, one of the 16th president of the U.S, once time said in during in civil war said to his people or audience, we have to be strong, does not matter for us how hard is life is it . and he continue his speech he said. whatever success, going from failure to faliure without loos any of enthusiasm. he said never contrition in your past. the constant to be succsess consists of going from failure. and aslo he siad that, this a good convenience for everone in consequence Lincoln, said you guys have to conscious and be awake all the time. this confirm to everyone or to all of us key of failure is in success.

other peoples , did not agree what Abraham Lincoln said. must of them said this is not compulsion or compulsory, they said this is over las conclusive in our decide we want to success one time without lossing any enthusiasm or failure.

In my opinion that "" succcess consists of going from failure to failure without loos of enthusiasm. we agree in this prompt. because before that i said faliure of key is becoming in success in our life we should all battle with failure we all know that way is become austerity. we have to fight with failure we did not want to win us. we want to success,in improve our self.

Many people making a mistake in thier life some of them success, and most of them failure. this is our life.

no mather success congsists of going from failure to faliure. some people dismal when they got failure in thier life.

They are become depression most of them and finally when they got success in thier life they are become happy, and depreciation. of course that"" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.",human
"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better.

One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes.

Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better.

Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way.

In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives. ",human
"MEMORANDUM

I See no problem not a big essue about using cell phones at school,a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents,students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons.

However, some students can take to other side,and don't pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"".

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",human
"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.

"Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Many people may not have experience and never but I'll be a great candidate to hire because I'm hard-working and I'm responsible.

I'm a great candidate that employers are looking for because I spend time volunteering at school and working with job owners as a helper. I take care of people kids and work as a school bookkeeper all school year. however, some people may think having more experience is better than being responsible, having experience help but having responsible help employers trust you more with important job. But I manged how many people check out book out of school and I clean the library some times. Later in the year i volunteer at a two company has a filer. I plan paper for employer because they know that I'm responsible to do the job and get done.

In addition, Im a hard-working person because I have a job and play sport but I my time to volunteer some time. I do a lot of work so I don't have to do anything later or the next day. I was a food stocker at my job but now I'm a manager. Because I work every day and put all my heart to complete my job every day. I never miss a day at work are late I come to work ready I check if every is done if not I do it before the store open and set plan for the day. I put one hundred percent in to everything I do in life to finish with my task. In fact, most people are lazy and don't want to do any work are complete any task there boss gave them, but a hard-worker will get the job done than a lazy person. But I may not have any experience but I'm hard-working and responsible to do my job on time and responsible to do important work for employers and other people that ask for help. Even though I don't have any experience, I'll be a good candidate to hire for the job.       ",human
"Dear principal I agree with the school cafeteria plans because our health would be better if we eat healthier than chunk food, It will makes us not get obese and fell into depression, healthier food makes your body be more active.

Does healthier food makes your health healthier?, is obesity a problem for students?.

Healthier food would make our health be healthier, Instead of eating chunk food we should eat healthier school lunch ,because If we eat healthier food it will be easier for us to do any sport because when we eat chunk food our stomach feels heavier than when we eat healthier food, professional athletes they maintain their shape because they always eat healthier food.

It will makes us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food and we don't eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we can't stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they don't like that way they look after they weight increase.

obesity is a big problem for our health, because it can take you to the level that you will not be able to walk.

Healthier food makes students be more active, when we eat healthier our body don't feel to heavy so we are able to move faster than when we chunk food. Chunk food makes stomach heavier that after we eat it makes so lazy that we don't e want to do anything after lunch. Healthier food activates our brain like when we do exercise we activate our body .

In conclusion i think it's a great idea this new plan, changing the school menu into healthier food because it will make our health be healthier, It will help us not fell into depression, It will make us be more active. healthier food is the best the school cafeteria can do for us because they will help us prevent obesity and they will help us take care of our health.",human

Do you have to be positive attitude to have success in the life? The answer for this question yes, because in the life everyone should be positive, and successful in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Their are a lot of reason's and evidence to have good life. The most important one is be positive because being positive make the life better. For example, when the person are positive that will make the person have a lot of friends, if the person are positive that makes him/her happy, and the person will pass all his/her test with good score or in his/her job be the smarter one.

First, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because when the person positive that will makes him/her have a lot of friends. For example, Generic_Name always smiling and positive. So, everyone in her school loved her and they want to be friends with her. So, now she is positive girl's with a lot of friend's. Being positive makes the life more better. As well as, if the person are positive he/she will always be happy.

Second, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because that help the person to pass all his/her test with good score or in their job to be the smarter one. For example, Generic_Name student in high school, and after school he works. Even if he has a lot of stuff to do in his school, and with his job, but he is always positive person, he helps anyone need any help, and he always get the highest score in his test. Also he is the good person in his job. Positive person will have the most beautiful life and will live with peace.

Some people may argue that to try to be a positive person because the world we born on sometimes have a lot of problems. That is true because the world looks like the mountain sometimes hard to claim it, and the life looks the same usually it's hard to be happy and positive because sometimes their is a problem or something happened makes you feel sad, and negative, and makes you feel that you hate your life, but everyone have to try to be positive, and to love his/her own life because if the person always negative that will makes him/her sick, sad, mad, and complicate. However, to be positive that will protect you from a lot of problems gonna happened to you.

To summery,

in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Just be positive to get the most beautiful life ever. Overall, if anyone want to be positive is not the hard work it's easy, and again relax, and get the good breath, try to lose all the negative ideas. Lastly, enjoy with the positive life. ",human
"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it.

Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.

in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. The students will become positive and get good grades because they made a decision that could possibly impact their future goals. ",human
"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good.",human
"I think some student take a class at home because they live to far or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it most better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they wants to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school but they take the bus or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online becuase the school very important however not everybody have the same opportunities.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

But in my opinion some people is possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools but they can pay classes for online but is not the same like the schools but they can due if they have dreams they can due because everybody have dreams.",human
"Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the.

"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.",human
"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. ",human

"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides.

"Since I was a little kid my dreamed job has always to be a mechanic, and you might ask why do I want be a mechanic well; when I was little I remember watching my dad fixing cars all day long, at the end of a long day of work I always got played with my bicycle and whenever my bicycle got broken I remember running to my dad telling him to fix it, and I loved watching him fixed it, so whenever I was not with him I always knew how to fix it by myself, when I started to grow I began helping my dad more, he never actually led me work on a car because he said that was it dangerous, but when I was going try

I had to come to the United States and I never learned nothing about car so now that i'm big I'll love to learn more about car and how to be an mechanic.

To be honest I remember telling my dad that one day I was going to be the greatest mechanic of all the time because I wanted him to saw that I could do it and make him feel proud I remember him smiling and telling me that

I could became whatever I wanted to be in this world I just had to worked for it and don't stop until I reached my goal, the only memories I have with my dad are me working with him, we did not spend too much time together I only saw him when he was at work and some weekends because he did not leaved together but now that I'm big and I can make my own decisions and have the opportunity to be anything in this country I want to be an mechanic and make my dad proud.

I know that been a mechanic is not easy and it takes a lot of skills, patience and practice but if I ever get the opportunity i won't waste it i will give my best and i will focus and try to give it all because my that once told me ''nothing is impossible it can be very hard but not impossible'' I'm always having those words in my mind because i'm that type of person that it won't stop until it gets what he wants and all i want is to lean how to be an mechanic and while doing it make my dad proud I'll love to have the opportunity to explore an mechanic company I'll be very thankful for giving me that opportunity.

I'm also looking to be an mechanic because I love cars and when I get a new job I will buy my own car and if learn how to be an mechanic I won't have to pay somebody to fix my car when I could fix it by my own when I always had like and obsession to open stuff and take everything how see how every little thing makes a function and how all together make a hole system works and when I'm finished taking everything out i like to put them all together as before and if put everything how it was maybe thats why i like math so much because in math there are many different ways to salve something and at the end they all give the same answer and cars work almost the same way and I would like to open a car and find what is wrong and see how to fix it and get paid by what i love to do  ",human
"Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society that's why they cannot focus on their goals in life. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished.

One reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because I'm too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because I'm new here in this country and I dont know anyone. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. That's why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. I have an five A's in my classes right know and I'm proud because I accomplished something. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right ""Determine never to be idle.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.""

we should never stop doing something that can benefit us. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dad's personal experience. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didn't expect that it will happen. Unfortunately, my dad's business went down because something happened that he didn't liked. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dad's store every night. That's why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. After a few years he didn't have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living.

Another reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what you've accomplished. For example, from the movie

PELE

it is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas' quote or saying ""All in or nothing"". For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what you've done in life. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals.

The other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. For instance, I've been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person.

To conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life.",human
"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

"78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.",human
"I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help.

"While students are in Middle School in 8th grade, they get the opportunity to see many career's and see which one are they planning to take or have an idea of the career. students should have the opportunity to choose their own career, sometimes students are force to take the career that their parents want. Why? because in many occasions they do not have another choose. In this decade teenagers have the right to choose the career that they want to study. In High School students are preparing and learning different elements and different skills, however; learning others skills benefit teenagers in their future. How? and Why? because learning different skills prepared teenagers for any jobs or if they have any kind of problem anywhere. Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Their mentality is improving each day. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.

In some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. That is why so many people come to U.S. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future. Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, ""the education here is not going to guide you anywhere"" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.

The importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.

Teenagers will have their life set after High School.

Teenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.

They will have a good job.

Ensuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career.

"Does technolgy have a posistive or negative effect in your life? To me it does because it allows me to complete many things without having contact with others. For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.

Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.

There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology

For sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.

To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more . But sometimes they can also be negative things but negative things also happen in life so its okay for that to happen. So Technology is good for life becuause it can bring posetive effect.",human
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!",human
"I agree with Ralph waldo when he said's ""to be your self in a world that trying constantantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments.""

although being yourself is a very hard thing to do especially when you have nobody buy your side though it all at first it seems easy but once you try so hard to make people proud you would wanna feel like fiting in.

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we woulden't care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives.

Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around.

Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives.

I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we should've been proud of what diden't thad happen.

So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you.

Thank you for your time hope to hear from you very soon.

"Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. For those who can pay a fee for it would be perfect because they have the material to do that, like enternet, computer, or any other device to joing by online or video conferencing classes. Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world. ",human

They do draw, They had the same teacher everyday, They had 4 teachers, one of gym,other of music other of draw and the teacher of scients, math , They go to the lunch 11:30, In the morning in the cafeteria they can take a bag with food inside the bag had apple, milk,juice, and then when they finish the they put the trash in the trash and when is time for lunch they go to the cafeteria and take the food sometimes they eats in the class, Sometimes they eats in the cafeteria to, If you don't speak English you had a teacher of Spanish of depend what language you speak she help you to what do you need, They give a dictionary to you, That helps you to search the word you don't know, They don't fight is rare to see is fight in elementary school, Sometimes happened but is rare when that happened in elementary school, A day in the morning in the cafeteria two boys start to fight that was fast because the security coming to the fight he separe the the guys he take to the office and everything was fine, But in elementary school the fight are fast, In middle school or high school the fight are extreme the security don't cant separe the students because sometimes the others students coming to the fight to sometimes is because they friends are in the fight and they wants to help the friends, Everymorning when you enter to the class i always take a computer and i do what i want that is good, Because that help to learn more English to me.

This important, Because when was in elementary school i see that sometimes the teacher said today everybody had to take the food and coming to the class we are going to wacht a movie, Sometimes we had to go the music class the teacher of music class she was a good teacher, Sometimes we to the draw, Sometimes we had to go to the gym to play soccer, The most what i like of elementary school was the teachers she's always help me in my work,homework, Is important because when i coming of my country i was in elementary school, The first day of school for me was a bad day, Because i don't speak English the teacher asking something to me but how had to answer i don't understating nothing what she is saying to me, Is important to me, Because everyday we go to outside in elementary school we play a lot games like soccer, basketball, the lesson is important, Because i put things happened to my friends, I put things what i see in elementary school",human
"I disagree with the school board extending the school day by one and a half hours extra.

Because Students will no have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework,

also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family.

If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework , and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed.

I like have my free time to do mostly what I want to do but if the school board extended's the school by an hour and a half then we wouldn't have as much time for free time and we wouldn't be able to go outside and play with are friends or play video games, everything that you like to do will be shorter.

Do you like spending time with your family I like spending time with family but if the school board extends the school day by one hour and a half then you wont have as much time to be and spend with your family like going outside for a walk or playing games or going out places like to eat and those times are going to be making memories not being in school most of the time.

Thats why I think students shouldn't have school extended one hour and a half so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with there friends , and finally so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them.",human
"According to the text I think is a good idea that students can graduate from high school in three years because if you graduate from high school very early you are going to get a lot of opportunities to be successful in life, I also think that if someone decide to start working contraction or hard works like that early, three years later that person going to get a lot of experience and money and if you decide go to college or some like that when you graduate from college you going to be young and ready for life, that's how a lot of people became millinery, because the must time you spend doing something that's more experience that you going to get, and when you got experience and you know what you doing, and what you want you life going to be better and easier in the future.

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you don't going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so you're going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level.

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him

"" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that' s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything.

is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad don't going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life.

In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don' got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,human
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it should't defined who we are. First impressions don't always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking

First, no one is perfect. We aren't perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That's when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can't change that or let it get the best of us because we aren't perfect and it's okay if sometimes things don't go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.

Second, it should't defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don't like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isn't you is just a part of you that doesn't think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when it's the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but that's okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that.

Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Let's say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we should't let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We can't make people be our friend if they don't want to. If they want to get to know you they will.

Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. We can always try again another day, it should't get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And that's okay, it doesn't defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions should't even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always. Don't let anything like that make you think less of you. ",human
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on your experiences, do you agree or disagree with Emerson's statement? Take position on this issue. I believe what author Ralph Waldo wrote is true.

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

In conclusion, you should not give up on something you love to do nor let someone tell you what you can and cannot do. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right , work hard and you will be successful.",human
"My talent is i'm good at drawing when i draw i like to draw the stars, the moon,woods and the ocean, drawing is a talent where you can express your self by showing multiples of types of art ,there's a lot of types of art my favorite type of art is the one where you draw. When you draw you can do make whatever you want and if you made a mistake you can fix it ,my other favorite type of drawing is the one where you paint, because you can paint what are you feeling like if you're sad,happy,angry,upset. Art is one of my favorite talents i can make whatever i want and peolpe pay a lot of money for the drawings or paints they don't care if they cost billions of dollars they pay it, because it's beautiful art. Art is a talent that a lot people have it, some people are so good at it, that sometimes they think it's not good enought so they decide to throught it away, but they don't know that some peolpe will like it and they will pay it for their art. Art cost a lot of money but some people don't sale their art, because they want to keep it for memory or because they want to show it to their family and sometimes they sale it to their family, but they don'tsale it for billions or millions of dollars,because it's for their family. Smoe peolpe when they make mistakes on their art and they don't fix it and they don't thourght it away they just keep it,because maybe some rich people will buy it.

I think people should try to sale it

,

because they can get a lot of money for their paints or drawings. Art it's a really hard jod you need to be patient, because you might make a mistake and u have to start all over again, people don't start all over again what they do is they can make something beautiful of that mistake and by the way art it's also about you see something ugly, but you can fix it and make look beautiful.

Some people think art it's boring,but it's not, beacuse if you love doing art you don't think it's boring you love doing it, because it makes you happy and sometimes when you're so happy and exited to paint you don't have the control and you just start paint and you dont care if it's ugly you just lating your body do his work, because you're so exited about it that your not even think what is going to look like, sometimes i do the same i late my body to do the work by his self and actully it does fell good you happy and so exited.

Other peolpe get so stress when their work dosen't look how they wanted to be, sometimes i get stress out too, because i think my draw dosen't look good how i wanted to be, but like i said you need to patient, because art is not an easy jod it's hard. But when you get use to it it's hard but not that hard like before, i'm good at art but im still learning and sometimes it's really hard but i need to be patient and keep practicing, because practicing makes the teacher.",human
"I think that he is right in what he think, about the consists of succession going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, because if you loss your enthusiasm in something that you are doing you loss the interes in it, but if your enthusiasm is to do it, you can do it many times you want the failure is just a little rock in your way to made your personality more incredible and unique from other that just give up at the firts time.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we don't try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to don't have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesn't give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not.

An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesn't had the job because he didn't finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decide to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasms in his life, he never stop because he didn't had the job at his first try he continue and he did it.

I know not everything is rose color but sometimes you need a little bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure it's not mean that you are a loser, not it's mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.

And the end the technology make the lifes easly and helpful;safe time,make anything be done on the time, so we can say technology refund the time for these who always busy.",human
"In the actuality, many schools have been a good support for all the students that want to continue studying, and have goals for their life, the schools provide opportunities and have partnerships with companies that allow students explore certain occupations.

It's hard for many students to choose the career they want to study, some students leave school after high school, so they loses great opportunities that the school provides, but my dream is to have passion for a job, so I want this opportunity to make a good decision whether if I want to study marketing, through internships and shadowing opportunities that the school provide. I'm really interested in this oportunity because I want to learn more about marketing, which is the business of promoting sales of a product, as by advertising and packaging, also learn about inform new innovations and persuade the people; I'm really creative, I enjoy making posters, using social media, talking with people, and I can speak spanish, english, and a little of french, also I want to have organization and administration of the things, however, I'm interested in pursuing that type of employment, that the manager of a business can tell us his experience, to motivate us because if you want something you will never give up, I will always put all my effort to be a better person.

In conclusion, I hope I can have this opportunity, to make sure if marketing is the job I want for the rest of my life because it's really important to choose the correct job, the people need to have passion for the things that they do , so they can enjoy and be happy everyday, and I want to transmit that feeling for everyone.",human
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be.

First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached.

My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

One major first thoughts of a person can be the way a other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet . There is a lot of people in this world whos first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. But than theirs many other people whos first impressions are changed.

In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but thats why its called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently and your thoughts will change.

"BEING YOURSELF.

Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.

people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.

The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.

With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.           ",human
"Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. Students should not have after school homework club because you won't have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they won't be able to play their favorite sport.

First of all, students won't spend time with their family. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. This proves that after school can affect on family time. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant

just because school.

Secondly, students won't be able to play sports. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. For example, Generic_Name

plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career.

Finally, if you like video games their is only video games

on the weekend if take this club. You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he can't stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didn't got to do on the club and is to late for him. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had

a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club.

After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. It's difficult to do two things at once so don't do after school club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Don't do after school homework club if you don't want extra time in school.                            ",human
"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",human
"I would have to agree with otherwise you try to do something in other side what you have is already mastered, you will never be successful, because whatever you have in your life is still nothing you should have a specific goal for you future, enough confidence, and demonstrated yourself.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they can't do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful.

like you see is their break and is not fair to obligate a student to do a project with out a vote to give them a choice to pick if they want to do it or not.

An example of technology is in schools every schools used for is students , like in my school every student have a chrome book for do tasks and every classwork we due in the chrome book , the teachers have mac's for due tasks and this is my examples to why is positive in our life , i think technology has been modernize , a example is in the hospitals for take care of us we have technology , that is amazing technology can save ours lives.

A reason why have positive feelings about technology is because all examples i give you , another example is the police need technology for catch bad persons and technology make more easy tasks for a cops , god blessed the technology , i think we need technology for modernize , acceptable , and attitude, for a person get used technology is very easy only you need to practice and is a very easy to learned the technology.

I advise technology is for make easy your life that is all , you have work hard to do easy with technology because technology today in day have everything, you are a better person with technology , my thought is one day have we dependent about technology because this is the new fashion and everything , a example is the cars , today every car have technology , my thought is one day technology can make fly cars , and i wish that is the future.",human
"Having a more advance learning can be beneficial because of career experience, graduating early, and recommendation.

Career experience is important to human society because it is needed in order to earn money. Some school provide programs that have different career. Student can have experience on what is like in the outside world. Without the help of the school program lot of student have difficulty on finding jobs.

Graduating early means that a student have master they're learning. They have the opportunity to start there career that they enjoy and have the requirement. Pre-AP classes, also advance learning can give students scholarship. Pre-AP classes means learning College while in High School.

Recommendation also falls on the same place as graduating early and career experience. When a student have master there learning they get to go to a special school that is more advance than regular school. They have reach the point where they succeed in learning.

Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. They can also get help someone make a better choice.

Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next.

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions.

"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers. Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble.

When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didn't check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it.

Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she could't sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didn't our parents.

Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good.

Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble. This are all my tops three reasons.",human

"i strongly agree when the Former British Minister Winston Churchill say how failure takes a extremely important position in success. To success you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing so you can get it right and success on in. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame,

Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it.

Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. During life you are always going to have ups and downs everyday, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stops you from success and doing what you like. During success you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in. You are going to start thinking i can't do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i can't do this because my friend's and family members say i can't do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong.

Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it ,

you have to take steps by steps to do it. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you re always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing.

""success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm""is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time. Ia the quote that you have too keep on mind when people tells you that you cant do anything because you fail it your first time. is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. thats where you are going to known the meaning of the quote. and you are going to see that all hard work you have done it was for a purpose to success more in life. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life.

"A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere.       ",human
"Most students who want to graduate before the years, that they should be take. Students with the capacity of make their mind strongest, go to their limits, and make one year early. Schools that allow students make more short their school years, if better for most of students who want get their diplomas, enter college, and start a career. Students who have a lot responsibilities and their want a diploma. These program is good to make steps in life. I think college do not have a specific age, just with your goals to make everything without leave school is strong enough to make a year early.

Those plans do not make problem, if just a way to finish what you want many people admire those people and see their potential. when a student have a early year because want a start to make a goals. If you see, passed, and remember high school lesson you will be fine, if you study and make your task these option will be good. Many reasons that take people to get these program, if because they usually do not have enough money, have to work, and need to study at the same time, everyone do not have the same opportunity opt for study during summer or online classes.

If you analyze students work after school, they want to get a diploma and make a force one year, when they make get one year less that say you are study and passed your classes different can be when teachers give you a year when you don't know nothing and teachers approve your year that's different go college when you have no idea how react to many classes than you never see or never show during the period of high school, the students that study during summers or in the evenings are focus in their classes that's because they finish fast and go college to involve in a new goal.

Example if you go school and need to work you'll to opt for study in summer or in the evenings that's your best option, students follow to take courses because it's a better idea maybe do not be the same learning, but with effort you can advance. Is not important how many years do you spend in high school, the think is what is your percent of each class. how you can involve in college: studying, focus, and remember what you see or learn.

In conclusion each student have different way to think how want to study and how many time want to spend in high school. Most students who take this decision if because they have to work and can spend much time, and they sacrifice some summers or evenings to get close their goals and each one do what is more beneficiary for their way. For me, if a good option opt for finish fast school and start a new stage in our life.",human
"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",human
"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them.

"In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone. ""Super Smash Brothers"" brings others closer together with their families and friends.",human
"Self-confidence is really important for people to feel good about their own selves. Building self-confidence may be hard on some students because the way they was raise or the way they are treated by others; Students should be able to build up self-esteem for their own good reasons in life, learning may be hard on some students at first but is just one of the task they have to get through putting a lot of effort in to it wot be that hard getting it done will be; Others may believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. Students should be able to do work that they understand good enough at their own risk to make the effort of being self-confident. Some people may not agree just because building up self-confidence is not an easy thing to do or even an easy thing to accomplish in life. Does true Self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievements? Self-esteem comes from achievements; Achievements that you got to make the risk for put up in life throughout school. There i'll be some difficult times where you will want to give up in life times where you will feel like you just can't do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life.",human

"Well In this part I

think is good and bad idea.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.

if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn,

they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.

if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work. ",human
"According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school. I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course.

High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that he's trying go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor.

We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents.

My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior and he's going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class.

In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does.",human

"Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",human
"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because it's pointless, unfair, and not important.

To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. It's no where near educational related. It wouldn't be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class.

The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless.

In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. it's not important for students to take any of those classes. It's not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs don't require for you to have any of those classes.                      ",human
It has been aid that first impressions are almost impossible to change. For me i think you can change from the first impression. First of all you can come off as someone who don't care about anything or any one but when you get to know them your mindset change on how they are in your eyes. the second reason is i had someone that i thought that was the one the person i thought i can spend my life with i know it sounds crazy but my first impression was she was a good girl then i got to know her and found out she's nothing but plane evil and has nothing but hate in her soul and always trying to find something to blame me for just looking for es cues for her to do what she wants to do and Little do she knows its making my love for her fading away every step of the way. so in conclusion this is why i think that first impression arent really impossible to change because people family even loved ones change that why i think first impression can change.,human
"I think sometime is good online because any students no have time so many students work part time,then can't go to the school the better option is take a little free time and make online.

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

Finally : The online web is very well for everybody because in the web we can find the signification about whatever word, that we dont know and helps for keep going more learning for get good job ,after you can use the online web for look video that you are curious then helps own like better people make our life better for everybody, if you dont know the support your family the class online help for you keep gonig learning more .",human
"When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?

Many people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.

When students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. But many might not go for that career in the future . Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.

I see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. They do not like going to work as much. Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different . But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. When I am older , I want to be at least a little happy with what I have my career as.

In the other sides opinion, I do see why committing to a career at a young age is pretty important too. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.

Students still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. ",human
"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. There is a quote that says, ""If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else"". As the quote says, I think that it's very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. I agree that seeking for guidance from experts to make wise decisions can have a great impact in our lives. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily.

First of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions.

In addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. For example, having an expert guiding you will allow you to see his different points of view and learned from his teachings. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. Finally,

you will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you.

Some people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing what's best for you. For instance, when I was 10 years old I really wanted to make my own decisions that I thought were best for me. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Because my brother had experienced many of the situations I went through, he was able to help me and in many occasions avoid me from failing. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for what's best for you.

In conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your life's time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas. ",human

"when i first came to the U.S.A

i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

wall others say that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others because there are more thing that we can influence each others with technology made a lot for us that we can help and influence each other with other ways for ex, Google translator if i go to another country i dont need to show people examples of a museum or draw i can type it and show them or say it to them and they will give me direction and students that dont speak English can use a dictionary or Google to help them understand.

"Would you like to start your life early?

Graduating is a privilege in general for everyone. Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate.

In my opinion i support both sides of the story. Some people want to start their life early some do not. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you.

On the other hand i do not think it's a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two.

In conclusion like I said ""I support both sides"" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. There is never no rush. Always take your time its your future. ",human

"The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases.

When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. That's how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by.

Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start.

Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly don't want to do, but are forcing themselves. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so.

You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you don't currently want to do. It could really be just a phase you could be having. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you weren't pushing yourself to do something you didn't want to do anymore. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. I also grew to enjoying the violin more.          ",human
"It god to have a possitive attitude when you don't have a possitive actitude you not treat god the people and they feel inconforteble. I agree to this statement because when the people have a possitive attitude they can faund a job and to have a positive attitude is very important in life and also to have a god attitude is important in the hausehold.

First: I work in a reusturant and I always have a god attitude with the costumers for example, I now a manager how work in the reastaurent she always have a negative attitude, and I think that is not god to have a negative attitude ,

to have a good attitude help a lot to have a job in my oponion a think that if I have a possitive attitude I can work very well and also a think that possitive attitude that we have is because the parents of as they teach as how we can have positive attitude .

second: I have some friends that they are negatives and that is not god we have always to are positives some people think that is god to have a negative attitude and is not real if we are negative we can do thinks bad , my mom always tell me don't be negative that is not good that why I'm always positive, my grandma always tell me don't be negative .

Third: positive actitude is good to have I think if we are happy we have a possitive attitude all people can have a positive attitude,if people don't have a posittive attitude they can't get a job that's why all people can have a possitive attitude is important if we have a positive , in all the works they need that we can have a positive attitude because in my job a girl how wants to work in their but she just went one day when my boss are treaning her she dosen't have a possitive attitude that's why a think we have to be positive always.

In conlusion if all people wants to have a job they have to learn how to have a possitive attitude if you have negative attitude plis change you attitude the negative attitude is not god in work or in oder things , we need to have positive attitude always , the positive attitude depend and how we traet oder people if you don't want to see oder people sad for you bad attitude be positve, have a positive attitude always .",human
"Did you know that staying active is the path to accomplish our goals? Staying active not only hepls us with our goal, but with health too. To achieve our dreams we have to keep fighting and take the long run. Our knowledge is gather by all the activities we have than since we were only childs. In my opinion, 1. we can accomplish more if we stay active,

2. Activities helps us gain knowledge and expiriences, 3. We build self-steam and confidence in ourselves.

First, we can discover and implement more if we can stay active. For example, we have a higher rate of winning if we are pertinacious. In the other hand, its wonderful to enjoy the world and whats around us. To sum up, descovering new places and getting involve are the most important moments in life. Having an active life can help us in the future.

Second, Activity help us gain knowledge and experiences. such as, growth of our brain and skills. It keep us healthy and stronger. For instance, performing new activities hepls us have an inquiring mind. If we are always doing something that will become a habit and it will make as a more mature, inteligent person. If we are always doing our objectives will be stronger.

Third, we build self-steam and confidence in ourselves. For example, our character grows and develop in a stronger and confident personallity. Our rate of achivement will be higher. Moreover, we stay strong as a person. To keep on doing you have to get out there and give everything you have. To conclude, doing will always have a purpose.

In conclution, we can accomplish more by doing. Activities play an important role on our daily life. Winning in any type of sport or at work makes us feel positive about ourselves. Our determinations have to be very complex. Being part of a team and have interaction with other people can be very supporting.

"Welll its going to be ah good beefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house .

(03/10/2020).

The oportunity the not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefist the school and the students beacuse they never going to miss one day of school and the homeworks and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they can't go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

But not everething it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they gonna stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiping the school. this its going to affect them beacuse they can't sociable with other people ,they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellfone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games,and they parents are not gonna have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class peapers oh using his fone to find out the answers. ( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) .

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My personal opinion:

In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i can't go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .

one sad fact:

In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

Extra fact:

In some countries i the world like China,South Korea,Russia... etc, the education in vidio its ilegaly in all school this is bacuse they think the education its have to be like the oll days paepar pencil and uniform (some schools in united states more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes the have to read every single book and the attendence its obligatory what i read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stinck ( like in some countries in south america) and the leave detention in the school and you have to writte in 10 oh 20 pages the i have to come to the school every day . sometimes they stay in the school all day bacuese they need study for ah test. I some countries ( South Korea ) its elegal have computers and cellphones in the school . in south america yeah they can cellphones and laptops in the schools but the problem its the internet so many people have to steall the wife to his neighbord.",human
"I believe on what Mr. Emerson said about being a master at something but not growing. In my experience In working In construction I learned how to measure wood, cut wood, and Install wood frames and all of that taught me how to be a more efficient person at my job. It also taught me how to use power tools and utilitys and for me I think it's better to know how to do different things like how to change the oil from your car or how to fix something that went wrong In your car like If something went wrong with your engine or If some hoses came loose. I believe If a person just want to know one thing and be great at It that's their right and that is acceptable, but they will be only focusing on one thing. But It's alright because not everyone would have the time or just would'nt want to do It. So I think it great If someone has already mastered something that they really like doing, but I believe it better to know many different things like construction or car mechanic or how to connect electricity wires because I truly believe that knowing many different things can give you more knowledge for the future.",human
"Generic_Name It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has been said that a positive feeling is the solution to be successful in life. To be with a positive attitude in life is the most important feeling for yourself, and some students can learn from their own personality. Some students had their own positive attitude because is the key to be successful in life. A positive attitude is the key to be desired in life.

To begin with, a positive attitude in life is the most important feeling for yourself. This point mean that to have a positive attitude is the better things in this world. For example, Generic_Name who had a positive attitude with a important feeling It can help her for her ownself or she can be a different characteristics. Generic_Name is showing her attitude in a positive way to make sure about the important attitude that she had. However, to have a positive attitude with a control to be successful in life is the most grateful key.

Furthermore, students can learn from their own personality. This point mean that students can learn skills, and lesson from their own attitude. For example, some people may said that having a really positive attitude in life is the most right things in the world. But being a person with a wonderful personality It can make that person with a better details in the future. A positive attitude you can be the key of your own feeling to success in life.

On the other hand, some people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life. But in other way you can also be the person with the positive attitude, and behavior. For example, Generic_Name It has been said that in this life the best way is to have our own success, and a positive attitude. Generic_Name have a positive attitude because he is saying the opposite of having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. This point mean that Generic_Name is trying to said that It can show everyone the differently attitude that a person can had.

To summarize, It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to sucess in life. For some people a positive attitude is not the key but for some of them is the positive attitude. A positive attitude It can be for some people because is can really explain to them the different direction of motion that they had in life. However, in this case people can represent to everyone their own attitude and teach other people the different between a positive attitude and a negative attitude in life. Some people may say that the most important things in this life is the attitude because is can describe everybody personality and the different characteristics that a lot of people had.",human
"Some people don't know how to play basket ball, Well I have some things that might help you with basket ball or build it or anything with the sport. The frist thing is the enviroment, most people play outside and others play inside, well I think you should play outside mostly on summer days because the enviroment is more cooler or warmer than other months. The second thing you should do is to try not to play in extreme temperature. The thrid thing is make sure its not high winds outside to be cold, this will effect your gameplay for basket ball if its high winds. Fourth thing is the good days to play basket ball, like summer days or sping time. The last thing for the enviroment is the day time and nigth time, you should play in the day time because nigth time you can't see much but in day time you can pretty much see everthing.

Equipment is important for basket ball, so here some things you would need for basket ball. The frist thing is a basket ball, make sure the ball is full of air and a frim grip. When play basket ball make sure the court is large enough for the sport. The court need to be a flat surface for the basket ball not to roll off. The next thing is a pole for the basket, make sure the pole is high enough for the basket and the ball to reach. The basket needs to be wide enough for the ball and a net that is short enough for the ball. The last thing for equipment is the out line of the court, it needs the out line for lineing up shots.

The skill of basket ball is important because of the gameplay is to win the game. Fitness is important for basket ball because it can bring up your stamina. Team work can make the game change from a losing game to a wining game, just by passing the ball to a teammate is important for skill. If you want to be good at the game then practice and trained your shots and make new openings. Strategy is important with teammates to win the game, think of new ways to beat the oppitsite team. Then you have planing, planing ahead is good way of back up plans to prevent losing. People just need to practice and trained if they want to be good at something.",human
"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it won't help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life.

We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because it's not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesn't matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess.

Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.

Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation ''Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesn't matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didn't give up because of that.

People have to know that doesn't matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesn't mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow "". Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in .

Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you don't know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day.

However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids,

teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke.

Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff.

In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doen't help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches.",human
"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three year and enter college or the work force one year early.

The students will have a all year they can use. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

Graduating in three year will help the students alot, it may take alot of effort, but its a gift and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their ealy graduation programe. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them alot in their lifes.

I think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early, because it will be very helpful for them in their lifes, it will give them the chance to eperience college or work force a year early, and they will have one more year to prepare their futrue.

"The first impresions

The next text is about ""The firts impresions can change with the pass of time"". The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime.

The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time.

The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false.

The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect.

In my conclusion the firt impresions it's very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change. I think when you don't know at someone or something is better wait a litte before make a bad or good idea about it. If for that I think that the firts impresions can change while passing the time.",human
"Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people.

For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier.

Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that won't lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. That's why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",human
"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.",human
"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want. ",human
"Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.

In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.

This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.

Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice don't think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. Again by attention I don't mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

"Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career.

Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time.

The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them.

Lots of work on a students can cause them to be stressed out. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks. Which gives them less time to do their work and study.",human

"Dear principal,

You are changing school policy so student that have a C average can not participate in sports or other activities unless the students have at least a B average .I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities. The parents ,teacher ,principal ,and the student should sign the contract .The students that don't even try to work hard to get a B average should stay an hour after school to catch up the work they have been missing. the students that don't recognized that what their doing is wrong and they don't get privileges like other students do.

"Students believe in praising them builds their self esttem,even when the work is not at its full potential. But others say giveb praise for deficient work undermines the learning by lowering standards

Although student get to proud and tend to over do the work, giving the student praise always comes out to be better than what they actually expected to achieve. Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving.

Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive.

Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding.

Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them. Therefore,the student knows that someone is always there to encourage them when needed.

In conclusion,praising students always tend to make them do better. In that case if the students feels good their work will be better.         ",human
"My Dad is someone who has shared wisdom and experience with me. And it's really important for me for him to shared that. Because helps me get better at things ,it teaches me new things that I didn't even know about, and also helps me grow smarter and as a better person. Learning from someone like my Dad.

Hearing wisdom from my Dad will definitely make me a better and smarter person. Because it will make me motivated to think like him and be like him . It will also make me work and study harder so I can get to where his telling me to. And not only I could be like my Dad one day I could probably be a better person and smarter person than him. Because my Dad would push me to work as hard to be the best.

Learning new things from someone that has an experience like my Dad can help me have more better ideas about what I'm doing . And it gives me an open mind about new ideas that I didn't even know about. It also helps me create new ways how to do stuff. And will also gives me better techniques and more ideas. So in the future I can try to change and try different things from what I have learned from my Dad.

It's also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I can't imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I don't even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them. And lastly it will make me think smarter and push my self to be the best I could be.

So I think it's kinda obvious that every person or even smart people needs help sometimes from someone thats has an experienced before. Because by just hearing from them will teach you new ways new ideas and even stuff you didn't even know existed. Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesn't have to a big thing it can be a very small things. But I think by just hearing from someone that has an experienced before will definitely help you to be better person.    ",human

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

"Failure playes a huge part of becoming successful. By failing people are learning on how not to make the same mistakes again. For example lets say that i was trying to become a professional soccer. I played for the best clubs, i was named the best player in the team, and i have never been cut from a team. One day my coche tells me that there is a professional soccer try out next week and he want me to get ready. So he gives me a schedual on what i should be doing to get fit. Everyday i have to eat right and train hard. I did all of those things somedays i did not want to train and just start eating unhealthy but i fought through it. Try out day comes and i was ready as i will ever be. we started out with warm ups and went to drills. I was amazing. i was like the best player at the fiald. at the end of the day they gathered every body up and called all the people that made it. I was not one of them. I have failed to become a pro soccer player. Now this is the part where enthisiasm playes a role. I can eather stop playing soccer and choes a diffrent routh or i can pick my head im and try again. Failing tests you on how pationant you are at what you are doing and are you willing to fail again and again to be succesful. A good example would be the book persude of happynes. In this book the main person makes a muchen and he wants to sell in. But nobody would buy it. He was also a dad with one kid and lived in a motal. he got kicked out of the motal because he was not able to pay his bills. So he was homeless for a cuple of weeks. Even though he was homeless that did not stop him from trying to sell his machean. Still nobody was willing to buy it off of him. Finaly after his ups and downs somenoe bought his muchean. The person that bought it told some people on how good the machen was and they started to buy it to. He became successful because he did not give up on his dream even though he was geting regected every time he tryed to sell it. failure is the key to your success.",human
"Former British Prime Mrimister Winston Churchill once said that ''success consists of going failure to failure loss of enthusiasm. ""Do you agree with of Churchil's statment about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success ? Take a position on this question. Use reasons and specific examples to support your ideas.

Yes I agree.

The Failure in My life.

The failure in the life is just the first step of counsel to success. From experince , I'm saying yes that the failure makes my life better. like when I came America with zero English that was the biggest straggle in my counsel. As emyplee , student and self developing.

Emyplee.

First, as emyplee it was not easy to find job because of English language. So way where was applying for jobs the company require have whether Spinsh or English so I can not speak any of other, for tow year I was just home, job no money to help my family back home because of language

But I did not stop after two years fund a job so I was dishwasher, it was too tough to communicate with my Mangers and employees too. They were making fun of me when I spook English. But that never stop me from what I want to do. Now I'm a superior in the pace I work for it. I did not let the language or anythings else to stop me back from what would me my life best.

School and Study .

Second , as student that was the hardest than that I though . No back round of school like knowledge or education because I never been in the school in my childhood so that made it for me so difficult to understand what the teachers were saying. So another attack of failure in my way, I did not no how to study because there was no one to help me what should I do in that time so fall at school. Because of what other people were saying about me like that impossible that you can go further than that you are now which is can not get high school diploma there were a lot of failure in my life .From failure to a big surprise that I making this year, I will be my graduation form high school and the nest will be collage. Because I do not what let other people make decision of what should I do or not.

Self development

Third was to wake to believe of myself and to make nay decision. there were a lot of pressure no me . I could not focus with what I was doing like school and work and other thing because of people around me. I could not eat well for two years and I got sick. All my families were worry about me. So over and over I fall of everything. And one day I asked one of my friend what you did to be successful in your life. ''she said be yourself and if you are important to yourself that will makes it different''. That word change my life to think positive. Nothing can make me stay a way from what make me successful.

And the end, as human our enthusiasm can make us stronger then failure. We have to look what other people did in the life because of enthusiasm. As human we can learn anyn things that we thought that is hard to learn it.

"So many students need to finish the school more early than others, it's a good think the student finish high school in three years, they have more opportunities for study wherever they like. Although some students will don't want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family.

Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they don't have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she don't have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like

5 or 6 years. This significant than student need more time to doing one thing fun before to enter the college. Additionally in the future may be they need another break after the finish college I opportunity the young people like travel too much and know others countries, they own country, they want watch new things, they know different s people, different language, different accent or pass free time with her family, friend, or play any sports. This is important because although they have time when they graduate at 18 or 19. Maybe if they finish high school when they have 16 have more time to graduate the college early and doing so many thing they like to do.

Another students want finish early high school to do others things so different like make a family and find a good job they like so much. So many adolescences think in money since so young , they need money, money for buy some material thing like a car, an apartment, so many clothes so expensive. This is important because the adolescences think finish most early high school is like they said "" if I graduate the high school a the 16 then a began to work like than i will have 21 i have all the thing I need for begin an alone life, then will want to married get a big family.

In conclusion, the this a good program of some schools than students can graduate in three years, sometime students need more time in her life for doing thing they like an the opportunities for choice a some long profession and have time to do thing they like or job for a better life.

"I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because in this world you have to be yourself and if doesn't mater how you are, you have to be yourself even if the world is against, because the world doesn't change you. You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"".

For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, don't let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams. Remenber if you felt 99 times, you have to get up 100 times, and never let that people and the world convert you in something that you don't want it, in something that you don't love it, in something that you don't wish or something that you don't enjoy.

Also in my life some people tried to change myself, but I always try the way to carry on and keep fighting for my drams, and one of my dreams was traveled to this country, and some people told me that I can not do it, even some people told me that I will die on the long way from El Salvador to United States.

That was a long and a hard way, a diifficult trajectory, but I did my objective. It was not easy, because sometimes I had to sleep in the desert or in some mountains, so the polices can not found me.

Also sometimes I had to move the one place to another placer and some pelaple and me did it acrros the cars, but we had to hide on the trunk of the cars, and I remenber we was like 12 persons on a trunk car. It was not easy but I did it.

I remenber some days that I had to walk for hours to be in some place close the border, and also some days that i didn't eat nothing because I didn't have food, and in some ocassions I feel that I can't no more, but on my mind I had a objective and a dream. My objective and my dream were stay in this country and to provide help to my family.

But in my mind I am keeping have some objectives and dreams, and one of my objectives is makes to my parents proud of me and one of another objective for me is be a example to my brothers, I wanna give it to them the best of the world.

My brothers and my parents are the reason why I work hard everyday, and I try to do the best on school, I try to be a really good students but sometimes it is hard for me, because the languages are different, so I try everyday to learn English, so everything can be easier and that can help me a lot.

You always have to be yourself because a more than a person goes to like you, so just be you and don't let the world change you. Keep dreaming and get foccus on your objectives.

Don't be afraid in a world that is constantly trying to ,ake you something else, just be you and don't worry be happy, enjoy the little big things that the world give it to you like friends and family, enjoy with people that you love, and always be thankful with everyhing, if doesn't matter if it is good or bad, everything happen for a reason.",human

ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL.

Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, ''I'' think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students can't be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money.

Many students can't be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when they're sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldn't be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too.

Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school.

Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support they're family with money. In some cases the student can have family ''(kids and wife)'' and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family.

In conclusion,

schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get they're work done on time and also save money for them self. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun).

"What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal.

First, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Most people in the world are gonna say ""practice makes perfect."" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldn't accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Things aren't gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder.

On the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didn't have any issues throughout their whole life. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Everyone was not smart when they were born, people got to work for it to get smarter. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science don't have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect.

In addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. Others say that it won't help their career in the future. People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all.

Lastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because it's gonna make people feel good about there selves. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they don't have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Also, it is a good idea if they study and learn the materials they could accomplish. Even if people don't succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.

"Students should have to commit career at a young age bacuse they can trust what their are doing. Studrents can reach their goals.

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

Students having to commit to a career at a young age to get an achiever in future, they doing what their trust, and they always doing what they know because they believe that whatever they trust puting them in a good way to reach them goals.

Ex: Generic_Name said,When she was young, to commit to a career was the best thing that put her in the best way, and believe her thing, when she belive her things, always she was in a good way and it always protect her life, and many people get to respect her, because there are people who was not having an respect to her, and it's shows her what kind of something she have to do that can give her the way to reach her goal.

Coulcaim:Many people said, Students should not having to commit to a career at a young age because it's not important in their life,it cannot help them anything at all.

Therefore: to commit to a career can teaching students nothing in their life, they cannot trust or believe them work or what they are doing.

Coclusion: To commit to a career in life makes students to understand many things, and if students trust them things they can get good safe in their life, they can teach others and protect their life, and students having to trust them things in lives, students cannot lives without trust what they are doing and reach their goals.",human
"I argree with haveing a afterschool homework club, because It well help out alot of students improve in school, and do better overall.

also don't you want extral help when you need it? students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework cause it could be difficult.

students don't really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go afterschool and do the work there teachers can help students out.

for example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parntents has to pay that teacher. and some parntants don't have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work togather to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parntents would not have to pay alot of money to make they child good at school.

a other example would be that students can stay afterschool with there teachers, but for a little bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club lets make it more than 47 minumies. More time equlas a lot of work getting compled.

in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers don't feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest.

overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.            ",human
"In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.

I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.

I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.

There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.

Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.

This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.

In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.",human
"A lot of people accomplish more if they are always doing something and others ask if inactivity also serve as a purpose. There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. Unluckily purposes don't come by itself as a miracle. Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and there's also some less complicated but doesn't make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"".

Some person's give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesn't trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . It won't be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didn't trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. We won't feel good after that and we'll feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldn't be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day won't help , think in what other people might think about us won't do anything than just make us feel even more weak. What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we can't understand how , what we don't know is the reality of how the live by the way we don't need to be comparing our live with others life .

, if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. After everything we'll feel great and proud of what we've done.

It is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I can't became more common and we hear that everyday. We don't do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they don't have time for them. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go . We can't limit ourselves with good stuff we need to spend time and learn new things , experience , teach other people and share our experiences and recommend and help others to never quit. Show others trust and appreciation for everything they get , be happy for them and give them more motivation.

Generic_Name an English teacher said ""People just see the defect in other person's life without seeing in their person's first"" . This is so truth , we don't see in ourselves first , we spend more time critizating and wishing bad luck to those making their purposes , feeling jealous of them because they could do it and we could't because we didn't want to put effort and time so we'd rather give up and do nothing than just complain about it and make excuses .That is not a reason , choosing a goal or purpose is something we need take it seriously because if you take it like a game then we are wasting your time , and the time of those person's helping us and going through all our steps , in our mentality has to be all positive .Being more strong than our bad thoughts feel proud of us,because we are doing something that others can't do. We are trying we aren't being like the rest and that make us unique ans specials, show to whoever said we could't do it or make it how wrong they were and they judge us before knowing our capacities. Demonstrate the people that was supporting us what we did to make them proud and we know how good we are going to feel that day. We don't need to take care of what others say, they might give us advises but we are the only ones deciding our actions.

What the quote means is how we make bad decisions an sometimes we just do what others do,or we just quit to something we were trying to do and it was hard so we drop off that and now we don't do anything else than watch others happy for getting their purpose. At the beginning of every subject we want to experience by doing it ,is hard , we got anxiety, nervous,sad,happy. It is so much emotions going on and we can't describe the feeling after we went through all that and we finally did it,we got our purpose we make it and the feeling of victory is inexplicable,we need more positivism in us.",human
"Dear, Principal

In my opinion, I think that you should allow students to bring their phones to school, but with the condition, to use them outside their classes. Students need their phones for any emergencies. However, students are to understand that teachers don't want them to be disturbing the class. Also, I think that the students know better to turn off their phones, if they don't want their phones to be taken away. Students still bring their phones to school whether you teachers and principal don't allowed them to. So, I absolutely agree with the policy of letting students bring their phones",human

"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years?

They would have to take more classes in less time:

Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says.

It will be more stressful:

As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. I'll say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOL's test will be taking in less time, I'm not saying that those people won't have enough time to study, but what I'm saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them.

The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldn't be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it won't be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attand classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Less take me as an example; I had personal problems before, and It was auwefull. What If It was so bad that I couldn't go to school?! Some students are just not good at school, and just prefer learning from home online or by video conferencing. Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with. You get your work done and you move on. their will be no more trouble.

Most of the times our parents say that going to school and socialism is good for us. Is that true?! Is that the case?! Well I am not sure about that, but what I do know is that I think we students should have the options to decide what we really are confortable with, and our parents should help us with that. Anyways, It's not like people at home are doing less work than people at school. We all are doing the same work, depanding on our grades. We all need to turn in our work on time or it will be counted late, same test, same quiez everything. The only differance between people that are taking online or video conferencing from people at school is that they are not going to school. They aren't in a classroom. We all have to studie for our test, quiez... But this is what my attantion goes to. Do students that attand classes from home, ever cheet?! we'll never know if they do. I would like an answer for my question, but I bet there will never have a proper answer.

There is a lot of resons why it is good for students to be able to take classes from home, and I will never be able to tell you all that resons. all I can think of is what I provided. It is hard as a kid or a young teens to go to school and have to deal with other kids, and I get it, because it is hard for me to deal with other kids too. But not all of those kids are hard to deal with. Online or video conferencing are not so bad themself, I will have done if I have the opportunity to.",human
"Should my school follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business to extend the school day to two hours for a four-day week? This idea has an advantage and on the other hand a disadvantage because student will be stress out, some will not get enough time to rest before going to work,and they wont get time to learn.

First,students will be stress out. There are different kind of people in a school,some may be fine when it comes to sitting for a longtime,others may have problems. Sitting down for more than three hours can cause waist and back pain. some students may be sleeping while the teacher is teaching. Example;if a teacher is teaching and the students are sleeping,the student will end up not hearing what the teacher said about the topic. When this happens,the student will end up failing the class which is not suppose to happen.

Again,most of the student will not get enough time to rest after school before going to work. There are a lot of students in high school who work and cater for their living. Majority work after school,therefore,they have enough time to rest before going to work. If the school hours is extended by two hours,they will not have enough time to rest and will be sleeping later in the day in class. Example;some people do not close early when they go to work,those student get a little time to rest before going to work.

This idea is important because,it will help teachers to complete their syllabus in time and also rest on the fifth day,and get time to be with their kids. some subjects involves a lot and needs much time to complete. Teachers always rush when they are teaching just to catch up the syllabus and students will not understand the concept they are teaching but when two hours is added to the time,the teacher will take her time to explain for the students to understand the concept very well.

I will conclude by saying,adding two hours for a four-day week school has a lot of disadvantages,therefore,my school should not follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business or else it will affect the academics of the students,and also weak the body since they dont have enough sleep.

"What is success without failure?

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams. ",human
"Taking more then one persons oppenion is a good way to make your final call for example, ther was one time where I wanted two differant books but I only had eangh for one. I had to make a good disagon becouse if I did not then it would have been a wast of $15. one of the book was called Nialarmstrong it talked about the life of Nialarmstrong and the other was called Dog Man it talked about a dog that some how got transformed in to a human offecer cinda like capton americ exapet hes not a super solder. My conclogon is paople should take more then one oppeinon.

I dicided to take my frends Generic_Name oppenion he told me to "" take Dog man it is so cool "" but i feelt like there was something about the Nailarmstrong book. Its always fun learning about other peoples storys and what they did to get to where they are. I did not stop there I wanted anther oppenion so then I want and asked the libarn oppenion she told me "" the nailarmstrong book sounds better to me but your choose to pick out the book that standes out the most to you"" so then i took her edvide and the book that stoude out the most to me was Nailarmstrong. and let me tell you I had a lot of fun reading that book. I evan told my frinds about it and they where like ""can I chick it out"" if i sed no i would sound disrspactful so I said sure ill bring it tomorrow in lunch.

Taking more then one oppenion might be time consuming but trust me it will help you make a 90% better choose then if you would just run in blind and start makeing bad chooses. That is what all of the succesful peaple do inclouding the prastent, besniss men, loyers becoase if the make the wrong call they could posibly face some vary big concaconses and if you want to be succeful you will have to be vary careful and take as many oppenions as posoble.

Taking peoples oppeinons could be risky at times but a good tip is to take that risk. What i'm trying to say is takeing a risk is not always bat every thing happens for a reson at lest that is what my parants said. taking big riskes is a part of our lives every human being took a risk at lest ones in there lives sometimes you would not evan know that you took that risk but in realty you did for example im take a risk typing this ovesly the conscances are not that big but they still mater in life.

My oppenion is to watch out, becareful, and take the risk like I sad riskes dont alway tearn out bad. if you do lesson to every thing I said in this your oppenions to others would change a lot and what i mean by that is you will look at many thing in a differant precpactive, your disagon makeing would change lats say you take six peaples oppenions three of them said there favert coler was blue and the other three said green now this is when a risk comes in now you are going to chose a coler lats say you chose blue now the numbers have changed 4 blue and 3 green so blue won. these thing is are in you every day life so you have to becarful,take risks,and take other oppenions.

"In my opinion setting a good example is the only way to influence people you're a good person. many people wont believe you're a good person just because you say you are. However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Lets say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you , you can be smart , responsible,and a good behaving person, show them a good example so they can be as successful as you. same goes to people dont show them a bad behavior or example, thats not gonna get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it , It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same.     ",human
"I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth.

They wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say.

Although I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.",human
"Many people believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Even if you always are failing in your life, but if you still have a positive attitude you can achieve your goals and be successful.

First, with a positive attitude the people are going to recognize you as a person that always like to fight with positive attitude an achieve your goals. Some persons are always trying to make you negative but you have to keep going and fight for your future. To demonstrate this positive attitude you can achieve your goals no matter what obstacle that life put in front of you.

Secondly, to be successful you need to have a positive attitude. Since the majority of people want the success, but the successful does not come over night. Something the success does not come as fast you would like. So you have to get out of your comfortable place and take control of your life without fear. The most important thing to success is to know what you really want in life and grab it with an attitude.

Sometimes it is not important to have a positive attitude to obtain success. In other words you just have to find your talent and prove in a different way that you can be successful. Clearly not everyone needs to have a positive attitude to have an accomplishment.

Surely having a positive attitude is beneficial to accomplish effectively what your proposes of life should be.

If you are not successful in something, it is because you are not trying something that is a passions of yours. you should use your talent and so you can change the direction of your goals. Obviously, having a positive attitude will help you success.          ",human
"LIFE DECISIONS

In every part of our life, we need someone to share something with them.

Maybe they are our family or friends.

In these days, people are more self-reliance. They think, we don't need anyone to guidance us.

But I think in every moment of life, we need someone, who had a lot of experts to guidance us.

Father and mother are the best persons, to share our everything in our life.

They have a lot of experience and important matters in life. They can feel us In every situation.

We always should ask from our mother or father, about our life decisions.

we should have someone to hear us and support us.

Our parent experience can be a lesson for us.

Experiences make our life. We should learn something from the experiences.

Life is full of thing, actually new thing. Everyday we meet a new thing in our life. That we don't know what is it? and where is it come from? Our parent are older than us, they know everything. They were in our age and now they're older than us. thats means, they understand better about us and about our situation.

My mom she always feel me. If i am sad even if i didn't tell her she know that I am sad. Because she's older than me. She was in my age before me.

We are like a person that don't know about anything, because everything is new for us. Because we don't have any experiences of the thing.

My uncle, he was 17 years old. He wanted to open a small fast food in our country. He always just listen to himself.

He didn't share anything with anyone until he did the work, than he comes and tell us that what I did.

Everyone was sad about him because he was younger and he don't know about anything.

His mother and father told him to finish school first then open a fast food, but he didn't listened to them.

He leaved the school and started his work. In the first he was so happy, but after a few months he become sad.

When he saw his all friends going to school and he works he felt sad.

He was so regretful, because of what he did. He didn't listen to his parent and he just did what he wants.

Than he came to his parent and said sorry, because of not sharing his idea with his parents.

My grandfather said to him"" I was in your age, I did the same mistake that you did, but in different way. I told you to school is the first important thing in our life, you can't leave an important thing in life"".""I had the experience that why i was trying to tell you that. ""My son always share whatever you have in your mind with the person that you can trust and believe, and listen to them, they will always guide you"".

Finally he understood, what he did was wrong, but he also like to work too.

That time he came to his father and share that he wants to study and work.

His father was so happy that his son come and asked him for showing the good way.

His father guide him and show him that what should he do.

He went to school and also continued his work too.

Right now he's a businessman, he always says"" to us to share anything with your family or friends"".

He said that to us"" the way that I am success and a good businessman was my dad experience, my dad guidance"".

I learn from my uncle that if your mom and dad teach you how to speak and how to eat and.... they also can teach us how to life good.

I always ask from my mom and share my day happens with her.

She hear me and feel me. Sometime before i say anything she know, I'm thinking about what and what I want to tell her. Having the experience are good, you know better how to solve a problem and guide someone who trust you.

If I have a plan for future I will share it with my mom, she support me and guide me.

"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.

Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.

One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesn't have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesn't include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shouln't offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school.

In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people.

In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make students's life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",human
"People are capable of making their own decisions. Guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and makes their own decisions. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves.

We all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. In our minds we think about different things in a situation, the good and the bad. Although guidance makes you sound weak, but we want to be satisfied with our decisions. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. In nature, most animals get to be self-reliance in order to stay alive, for example, as bear gets older, their parents have to let them go alone in the wild.

We have voices in our minds that we talk to, and get really indecisive. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing. An over-sized black hoodie and a regular sized white hoodie. The prices are in the same range, a worker comes up to you asks if you need assistance. Then you feel like you're being held back by people who offer advice.

When I read my prompt for this essay, I struggled coming up with ideas and examples. The thought of, what am I going to do, to make my essay satisfied so I can succeed? You feel like you need to find information yourself, managing your stress and time. The process of thinking about your ideas.

Our stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. Others can conduse issues more than solve them, at times. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding.",human

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.

Finally,I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.",human
"Without failure you won't succeed in life. Failure is something you didn't succeed or accomplish yet failure does help you succeed in life. As a matter of fact, this could actually help you accomplish your goals.

I agree with Ralph Waldo statement because, you won't realize your mistakes. For example if you only succeed in life you won't know what to do if you fail or how to fix them. There for you'll achieve and have more success by failing. This helps because you'll actaully know the struggle people would put themself to accomplish their goal. Also knowing you have fail you'll know what is expected in order the success.

I disagree with Ralph Waldo statement because you won't accomplish as much goals. For example you won't know what to do if you ever do fail. i mean is good that your sucessing in life but just wait until the unexpected comes thats whe all the boom lets lose. i fact success isn't as bad is actually good.

In my opinion i would say success isn't as better as failure. They are both a team. While i agree this is why i pick Ralph statement is cause the un expected always comes in lfe.  ",human

"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.

While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.

To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.

In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.

As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher don't give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.

"The greats benefits to work with a group

To work on groups is better for many reasons,everybody can help each others,in groups student's can do a better work,and it can help all the people on the group to learn more skills,it can help students to know each others and be friends, more communications, more ideas and sometimes it can be helpful to work in groups because some students don't know what to do,i thing teachers should let student's to work more on groups so like that they would help each other and work better,and is good to work with a group because that can help you for the rest of your life like on your job also with your family and you con do better and a great job if you work in group

It can be helpful for students to work in group,First, because with more people helping are more and betters ideas and more helpful for every students,and sometimes student's don't know what to do,but if somebody on the group help so he would understand and know how to do a great job and work with a group is much helpful than work alone on many ways like to understand better with communication with your group and it can be helpful so you can do a good work and pass the class and not failed,and work in group it can help you to know others people that are in the same classroom but you never have the oportunity to talk wich their so in the teacher make a group and you can joing to one there is going to be new people and you can know others people

,Second,it is good for student's to work in groups because they can learn more skills such like the communication and they can help each others with the written,and also they can help each others how the way they talk. The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you don't understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some student's need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students don't know how to do the work sometimes it because they don't understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some student's so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that don't know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers want's to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers don't wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more student's to work in group i don't think student's would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster

In conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you don't like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you don't know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you don't understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some student's don't like to work in group's sometimes it because they don't know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to student's work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication student's would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i don't know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",human
"Its a fact that possitive actitude is the key of succses. In every single thinsg that you made, or every single act that you take, even a small ane like blink if you are not confident in what you are doing, on that i will make it fealling, you will be failing.

That does not mean that fealing is a bad thing because fealing is a important aspec of successes. Not only because you will learn from the mistakes that led you to the failing box. But also you will come back knowing against what you are figthig with, next time you will be back with a diferent set of mind, with a diferent plan, even with a diferent actittude, and all that because one thing wich all the people says is bad.''Fail''.

"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle"" that is mean like some time we are busy. I agree with this prompt becasause it's something posible and if we always doing something.

In my opinion we acomplish more if we are always doing something because some times we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work it's some i like to do every day because that's how i learn more stuff. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are reciving money for your self and maybe you can help your parent with bills.

Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we ca have a vetter remposible. That is mean if we don't work or study for a vetter life them we are not going to have nothing for .Exaplem if you are

18 or more you have to look for a jod becase you are respomsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff. This is something posible we can do in us life.

Some may said that to do nothing is better life. they said that becsause they never think about thre future or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. for exaple I have a lot stuff to do for gratuade from hight school i have to pass my esol and have a good great grade if i don't graduate from hight school that choise i have is to work out side. However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choie is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better jod.

people Sometimes they're bussy in keys that is something posible in us life becuse we want to become a good person and resposible in the future that's that way we learn it is easy to do something never give up.",human
"I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't mame students do a other activity ",human
"Kids play to have different jobs, but I know, since I was a baby, what I want to do. The world of the entertainment, in special the theater, is something that always catch my attention, thats why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center.

The principal reason why I want to go is for my family influences, my grandma has been dreaming about me been an actress. I remember going to the theater with her, telling me that her biggest dream is, one day, see me on one of those performances or shows. When I was littler, I use to participate on local shows every summer, her proud smile and happy tears make me feel that I was on the right place, doing the right thing. I know she would be so happy if I become an actress.

Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,""The Rose"", the feelings that the esterpians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show. Imagine myself on that scenario with the lights, music, the public, while I am realizing a magnificent performances is something that makes my feel really grate. I want to inspire people in the same way that actors inspires me.

My love for the performant arts isn't the unique reason why a should go, I am a respectful and courteous person; a hardworker which goal is to learn everything about arts. Some students aren't really interested on the place they go, playing around, acting boring, but not me, I am really interesting in this opportunity, in all the special details of the world of preforming arts. From the backstage to the actual scenario, everything would be a delaitful experience for me.

For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater.

"Imagine going to school everyday to learn and experience new things, when it comes to lunch, students are ready to eat and enjoy there favorite food with others but the principal made an announcement about changing the lunch system by getting rid of junk foods to healthy foods. Students favorite food being replaced by healthy food will be a nightmare to them. No more pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc, will be all gone and will cause a problem. Removing students favorite food to healtheir ones will be a bad idea. Students will dislike eating healthy food, and students will feel hunger and lose concentration in class.

Firstly, Some students will dislike some healthy food that they don't enjoy. For example, Generic_Name goes to lunch and sees the only food aviliable is a salad. He never ate salad before but sees a lot of vegetables including lettuce, tomatos, onions, etc. He feels disgusted by the food he was serve and rather starve. What I mean is that students being served to vegetables which they won't take a bite of, won't make them eat because they don't enjoy eating vegetables that was served to them and might get student to not eat but starve which will be bad to there body.

Additionally, the students will be in bad shape during class time. They will feel hungry, sick, or possibly pass out. For example, Generic_Name came back to class from lunch and he didn't eat anything because of the food that was serve. While doing class work, Generic_Name doesn't feel well and his stomach starts to growl because he didn't eat anything. He will lose focus and will start begging for food. What I mean by that is students in class will feel hungry and there stomach will soon to growl and will lose focus on class instructions. The principal should not make these changes and keep the system of lunch the same because there body will be in good shape and will gain energy through out the day.

Some people will disagree my reasoning and opinion on changing the school food system to healthier ones is a bad idea. They will say say it's a good idea because they will consume healthy foods that will make students grow stronger, will have a healthy diet, and be more energized within there life.

That may be true but that's not the case because student are comfortable on what they eat and what suits them will suit there future lifestyle. Thus, changing students favorite food to healthy ones in lunch is a bad idea.",human
"Its been said that a positive attitude is key to success in life. I agree, I think its nessasary to have a positive attitude in your everyday life , in your work place, in your ""time of need."" those are the most important times you will need to show your best.

First , I think its important to have a positive attitude in your everyday life because, of the stress that goes on. No one will understand how you feel other than you. If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that.

Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for. If you set your self as the person who puts too much on themselves, you will never see growth. You can do the impossible it will just be up to you to change your circle.

Although, there are many people who live in doubt and build this wall of negativity in there life. You cannot be that person. Think about the little things in life , you have a roof over your head, your family is safe, you are safe. You never go a day without eating. Those are the little things that matter.

Lastly , in your "" time of need"" you should always be more optimistic. Whenever you are feeling down and feel like your world is falling apart be aware that your surroundings should never bring you negativity. There are so many other thing you could and should be thinking about, the little this matter in this life. Feelings are always temporary and you need to always make sure that the positive things impact you the most. Greater things are to come in everyone life.

In conclusion, being positive in many ways will always change your mindset . Positive attitudes are key to a better future and for the best success in your life. ",human
"I believe that schools should allow the students to graduate in traitional four years,

instead of three years because If some of the student faill the class or the SOL, they should a time to retake those classess they faill. Most of the students dont what to take a courses during the summers. Some students want to take a elective courses in schools not in summers chas as a art, muise, and language they want.

I personily believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think it's head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they can't graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill.

Most of the student's don't want to take a courses during the summer because they want to have free time , they don't want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They don't want to work for schools on summers. They're some family who love traveling with they're kids.

Most of the students want to take a elective courses but not in summer. Couses whay want to take is art, muise, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as a elective courese can help them in college or in work force. Some of the elective courese that students take can help them find out what they like or dislike.

Overall my position on this issue is that schools should offer a four years hight schools, instead of three years because it's can hlpe students to get ready for college and work. ",human
"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Because work is groups make the class successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. Here are some reason why

I think that work in groups is benefit.

First, They can divide the work in same parts. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative.

Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade.

Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student can't understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help.

In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better.",human

"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.

Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.

Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.

Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.

In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success.

If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.

In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",human
"I think it took a positive affect on humans lives. I think it would be impossible with out technology. My reasons are that we use technology a lot,we use it for to shop online for our phones. My two other reasons are we use them for work. We use technology for school and to learn things from back then from now.

We use technology for online and for our phones. So if we needed to contact someone it would be threw our phones. If we needed something to wear we go online buy something. If we needed go some where the in our phones theres GPS will guide us. We use our phones for lots of thing like looking at the news, or to see what time is it. Our phones has a lot of knowledge so if we need something new we use our technology

We use technology for work like if we needed finish something we know how to do it. If we needed look something up for work we do it threw our technology. If your boss calls you in for something hes using technology. So if we did not have technology we could not do anything that what we are doing today.

We use technology for our school like now Im taking test on my computer. We use technology for learning things like in history we are learning stuff from the past. We use technology for tests and to print some papers out. We use projectors for class if we need to see something. We use technology for our safety like cameras.

So without technology we could not do anything like call or text or shop online or learn. Are lives have changed a lot when technology was invented. Technology is all around everywhere you go theres going to be technology.",human
"Imagine you are going to buy some new shoes but you don't know if you should get them. So then you ask for some advice from family and friends. But you still don't know what to do. So then you ask for more advice. Then at last you all ready know what to do. So you can more. I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. All really because everybody thinks different. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too.  ",human
"My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"".

I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",human
"First of all, I agree with Minister winston churchill once he said success consists of going from failure to failure because when you failure somethig you have to see the important role the faiure plays in the pursuit success. In addition, you have to think about your ideas. Forexample, when I know the position of superviser is avilble at my work and traying to work harder and harder to get this position,but after three years of working hard they gaive this position to someone ealse at this time i feel failure and I keep asking my self why they did not give me the position. Moreover, after two month the manager taking to me about why I am not working hard same like before, and you telling him about the superviser position and you did not ask me for it you just give it to someone ealse. Socend, the city manager called me to ask me if I am still interstiing about the postion or not I said yes I am intersting for it. Then he meet me at the work and said to me to get the position you have to do a lot of things before I gave you the position I said a lot of things like what, I am always dowing every thing at work. Third, he said I have to work all the positions in the reastorant the positions are the following:Foodrunner, Host,Selver,and

Ketchen. And after all of that you will get a traning of two other restorants. In addition to that, I have to disid if I still need the superviser position or not, if I said yes I still need it thats mean I heve to do all the thigs what the manager said it to me to gt the position. FOrth, I accept my manager ofer, and i worked all the positions in the restorant accept the bartnder.

Fivth, the superviser position is good I will get good money and indepence on the location of the restorant our location in Washington Dalles International Airport. Thats mean the restorant always busy specialy Saterday and Sunday. Moreover, I am working with the campany since the open the restorant I am the seniorest preson in the restorant because the campany changed the manigment three times until now.

Then, when my manager saw me morking extrimly hard and when the city manager taked me again I am finaly get the suprviser position

Firs of all, when you going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm it is very great to have your enthusiasm and you have to belive in it, because this is the only way to seccess in your life.",human
"Do you think imagination is more important than knowledge? Well have you ever wonder how the first computer was made or how the first lightbulb was made? It all started with a imagination, if the person who made a lightbulb never had a imagination of building a lightbulb we will be using candles for a source of light. How a about google, snapchat or even, books it all started with a imagination. Thats why I think imagination is more important than knowledge.

We all know knowledge is very important but with out imagination we cant think or read because imagination is the key to knowledge. Without imagination we cant think and when we cant think we cant learn or solve every day problems. Knowledge did not just exist like that is was made how? By imagination thats why why learn and do things.

You can be the smartest person in the world but if you dont have a imagination you cant help the solve world problems like how to poverty. Imagination is very important because with out it our lives will be more difficult for example with out cars we wont be able to go to work or go places and without phones it will be harder to communicate. The reason we have cars books and computers is not because knowledge but because of imagination. Thats why Imagination is the key to knowledge.

Imagination is very important, why you may ask, well with out imagination we cant think of new ways to solve problems or read. Lets say imagination was never a thing we wont know how to read or count to 10 because imagination is the key to knowlege Without imagination we will be having a lot of problems like how to comunicate, read, think, or even count to 10 thats why imagination is important.

With out imagination we as people cant make new things like books, art, or even better things thats why imagination is very important in may ways. Imagination is the key to making new things like cars, phones, computers, books, with out imagination we wont have things like cars, or phones. It takes alot of thinking to make new and helpful things. If imagination was never a thing their never have been numbers, books, or even a language.

Imagination is how we have things like google, computers, cars, books, and with out imagination we cant think of new ways it make the world a better place.

Imagination is why we as people are advancing and getting smarter every day. Anything is possible if you can believe and think. Thats why imagination is vary inportant is many ways.",human
"In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it work for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school.

I think that's good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work.

When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career.

By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career,

before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything.

Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college.

I think that's a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.

Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios. ",human
"People who does not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project.

There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.

For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes.

Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others.",human
"We choose our own character traits. One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves.

The act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. It should be said that people are not born kind, they choose their own traits that fits them best. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future.

Rudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world.

The helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they don't go anywhere.

My counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are.

We choose our own character traits. One example of a character trait is the act of kindness, a person who is friendly to all the people that comes their way. A second example of a character trait is rudeness, these types of people are generally rude to everyone that comes their way. A third example of a character trait is helpfulness, a person who wants to help others in any way. I have chosen these character traits as they are the most commonly used character traits.",human

No, i don't represent the character traits ,i would like the British naturalist and politician to choose the character traits ,i also know that we must allow the British naturalist ,and politician to choose the character of the government to help raise the to help the US institutions and American individual who pass through the management that also cannot gain experience.

Therefore,American government should help the people to give or allow bass positions and cannot gain experience, i also give the opportunity by those who are one and highly options to develop the habits of passing out freedom for all African

Americans,and American .that will help avoid racism to people in America and also the make the politician allow Americans to vote""i can do to achieve it ""and i will also brainstorm my idea to help me do the right thing to do to help the British and they a saying that""I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGHTEN ME""this proverbs drawn me to help my fellow ones and also to achieve the little things thats letting me become a great person in the future some people achieve the smaller things that help them succeed

Another significant attitude is that these These Americans, is counted to give the logical manners of American that have the right to have the need to whatever pleads them ,like food,clothing,and all other resources i would love to help the government provide, but in all honesty, i also think we can manage stuff beyond our control by letting the president know what the government stuff in American will need to in other to help the homeless shelter and also providing whatever they request for like money,food and other kind in other to help them shine and happy .and helps me gets close to my family closely by going home to do my assignment ,eat .but when i also get home, i rest and do my laundry i try keeping my clothes clean everyday .

"If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you cant always have success ,there's times where somethings don't work out. Then there's failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that.

The one reason I agree is because there's time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down.

The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it.

So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful. ",human
"One way to improve student achievement is to start a after school homework club.

Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who don't turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early.

In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them don't ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they don't understand them, but if the school make the the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments.

Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who don't turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they don't understand the assignments and if someone don't understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students.

In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students don't care about school because they don't find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they don't understand.

In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you don't understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",human
"To keep the resources of the world, Can be necessarily to implement the idea "" four-day school week"". "" The four day school week"" consist of ten hours per day. Adopting this idea it is going to conserve energy and resources. If they spend the whole evening in the school they can learn more and be more prepare for school.

It's a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages . One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored an tired of it. It's not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they won't have enough time to make more hours in their job.

If the students assist to school for more hours they got the chance to learn more and improve their skills. In those 10 hours they can even get an extra class , a class that they want. They can have a lot of time to understand more their classes and be more prepare for them. Having that time will be easy to communicate with more people and teachers . The don't have to rush in class anymore , now they got the time to prepare more in class.

To implement this can be a bad idea because if the students come to school for ten hours they will end it up with stress. Be in a place for a lot of our can be really stressful If the students are stressful of school they won't do their best because they are tired of it. Not all the students like to go to the school and for them will be even more stressful. If the students have homework will be even more difficult to get a good rest. They won't have enough rest for them.

Some students got responsibilities at home like help their families at home or some of them have to work to pay their bills. A lot of students pay their own rent and they need to leave early from school and work more hours to effort enough . If they leave late from school they will work less hours and at the end they won't have enough money . Leaving late from school and working a lot going to make them tired of that routine. The students need time to rest as well. If they don't get enough rest to do what they want to do at the end they will end it up stressful and not doing their best at school and at work. If that happens they will have a lot of problems because if they don't do their job property the will got fired and without money to pay their bills. In school can happen the same thing as well with bad grades and not paying enough attention.

In conclusion having this idea can be a bad choice . A lot of students have things to do beside school like working or helping their families . Coming for ten hours can make them to stress easily .Student with stress won't do their best and at the end they going to have bad grades. The students need to rest and do whatever they want in their free time.          ",human
"Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early.

First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better.

Second, some students don't want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school,

Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer.

In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they can't think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life. ",human
"Where would i want to go vist? i would want to go to vist el salvador because i want to go vist my famliy. Also i would want to go the beach . Then i would love to eat their food that they have

My one reason i want to go to el salvador ,i want to go vist my famliy because i have not seen them in 6 years and i really want to spend time with them. Also i would want to spend with my baby cousin. the reason i would spend time with him is because he's a very special kid and he's very sick i would do many things for him. After i spend time with him i would take my famliy for dinner and they would be happy that i took them out to eat.

My second reason is i would want to go to the beach because i want to see how beutiful it is over there. Also many people say it's beutiful because of the ocean. Then i would want to go to swim! Many people say that the water is very warm because it's closer to the equitor, it's not like the US the water is cold. Then after swiming i want to buy a neckless for everyone in my famliy.

My third reason is i would want to try their food that they have because people say it's amizing. I want to try their poposa because it's better then the stores. The way you they make it,is they start with corn masa, then they make a mini bowl , then you can put cheese and beans whatever you want, then you close it you put it in the pan and let it cook. The best thing about poposa when they're over fill when the cheese and beans are dripping.

These are my reason where would i go to vist. we should vist many place because we can learn somthing new. Also we should try are best to go somewhere at least the cheaps trip you can find. maybe i would be able to go to el salvador.",human
"I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework .

I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3

pieces of homework .

Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A

. It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem .

In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder. Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework ''BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER'' but it does and. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .",human
"I think students should not be required to take a arts class . students have the rights to take the classes they want to take . If they like arts classes they are free to take that class . but students that don't like art class do not have to take the class .

For example i really don't like arts classes but i'll still take the class because at my school they do this thing that if we need to retake a curse class then we well have 25% of taking that class or if we don't need a curse class we had the 50% of taking that . It might be the same in some schools or it might be different it others schools. some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea .

Kds may want to have space to take the class they want and they can't because they are required to take arts class . Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boy's would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that it's boring for them to be in that class .

I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they don't like the class or something like this . That's why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take .

I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class .

it's really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that don't like drama and they don't let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be

. that's another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids .

This concludes my argument about students having to take arts classes . this is for all schools please let your kids to pick their classes . or at least give them one class that they like . like i said at first i really don't like this argument thats happening .     ",human
"I'm agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do.

For example:

If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences.

At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity.

Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.

"There are many that have responsibility in the world that we have to do and with those responsibility there will be many challenges that we as humans have to overcome to theses things in one way or another. A city council is debating adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night It's mainly because we're exhausted at that point we can't focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because we're bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now.

Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but we're actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.",human
"Dear principal,

I have heard of the school cafeteria's plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.

My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.

they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that "" if you have lemons make lemonades"" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.

In additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.

Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?

"There are some some school's that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some school's that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 year's of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 year's of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them.

if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else

In the case that going to college after graduating the three year's are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone want's and its good to have a goal in mind.

In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.",human
"Having electives classes can be a great opportunity to let students choose what they love to do and be lesss stressful. Schools, which do not have electives classes had become less popular. Students choose to study in schools that are less complicate for them. Although some say students should be required to take class in the arts actually, students classes should be electives because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit and they will have less worries.

Those who believe students should be required to take class in the arts have their reasons. They believe students have to be more responsible and pass all their classes. They also think students can learn how to be good in arts.

One reason, why class in atrs should be electives is because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit. For example, my friend Generic_Name he only had to take Algebra 2, English 12, U.S Goverment, and Chemistry to graduate this year. However, he had to take one class in the arts that was required to graduete. But, Generic_Name did not have more space during that day,

and the other day of school Generic_Name had to work to help his mother.

If Generic_Name did not have to take the class in arts. He will be able to graduate this year. In addition, he will not waste his time in one class that maybe will not be interesting for him. Also, he will be able to help his mother about taking care of his litter bother. When she was working, so his mother did not have to work less hours.

Another reason, why classes in school shoud be electives is because students will have less worries. For instance, my friend Generic_Name. One day she had to study for her History

ESOL. As well as, she had to make a big and beautiful draw for her class in art. Generic_Name took almost all the night making the draw ,so she did not have time to study and she fall the

ESOL. If Generic_Name did not have to make the draw for her art class. She will study for the ESOL, and she will get enough sleep. Generic_Name will be able to think and pass her test. And she will have more time to study. Sometimes taking a lot of classes is not a good idea for students bacuse it is to hard for them to concentrate.

To conclude, I believe that class in arts should be alectives becuase students will be more confident in doing what they love to do. Also respecting students opinions can be a great opportunity to demostrate them that school cares about what they feel. For those reasons I think class in arts should not be required. One is that students will use the free time more helpful for their benifit.

Another one is that students will have less worries. School have to see what their students need to make them capable and sucessful.   ",human
"Winston Churchill is a good person everybody knows that, a person that give good idea or a person that bring idea to life . Thing he say they are true, they can open your mind, and make you think.

Yes : I agree with Winston Churchill. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot "" try"" again. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.

If success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might "" successful"" after all.

1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. An in endurance can bring you to successful too, in time you'd need it.

2)If you pursuit or enthusiasm your can success anything that you thing that hard can be easier's for you, cause you put your ; Enthusiasm, and convicted your issue. Failure without trying "" does not"" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.

3) Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm will give you something in return, in that is ""fact"" no dispute about it. Even those who loves you can make fun of you, it they sees you keeping failure; or stay away from you on till you ""win"" or find what you want's.

Anabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy. There are tree reason that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

ONE, if you a failure in you didn't put your enthusiasm on you ""success"" you'll never be successful.

TWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.

TREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. As a Mather of fact , look at all the Hollywood stars' , some of them didn't born with success some of them were poor, having no skills ,and some of them didn't have no education. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be "" success"" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.

Winston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. If you a failure in then you loss your enthusiasm you will never be "" success"" . That's a true statement for success, in

I really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.

If you have a gold to be success in you though you a failure , don't like that why cause with : enthusiasm, and consists you can accomplish anything, even thing that you image you'll never accomplish or be success.    ",human
"People make their own decisions in life but, people can make mistakes in life. A certain people don't have have other people to help them with their decisions in life. People should seek guidance from experts because experts can assist people in situations, making sure that the person is doing it correctly, and give advice to a person that needs assists.

First, experts can help people about relationships in life for example a breakup, fights, arguments, trust issues, and lack of communication. They are good amount of experts who can deal with peoples relationship problems for example my father helped me with a breakup. my father said to me that ""she's not the only girl out there in the world"". I listened to my father's advice it helped me a lot. Experts can actually help through with your taxes and bills if you're having trouble, for example my grandfather who was helping my dad with his taxes because my father forgot to pay the taxes.

Secondly,experts can make sure if people are doing stuff correctly. Experts can assist people with their taxes to make sure if the person is doing their taxes correctly,for example my grandfather was making surer that if my father was doing his taxes correctly. Experts can make should that people is going to make sure that the person is doing the bills right,for example the mortgage for the house people need an expert to assist the person if they're doing the mortgage correctly. Not just the mortgage it can be bills in the house. Experts can make sure that the person is doing their car payments correctly in order to keep their car and not fall behind on their payments.

Lastly,Experts can give people advice in life,for example experts can give advice for taxes,payments,and etc. For example my father was giving me advice about how to buy a car because I'm getting a car over the summer. Experts can give people advice when the Person needs it to be successful in life. For example an expert giving advice to a person that is trying to get good credit to buy a house. Some experts give advice to people that are serious, for example people that are in a verge of crisis right now.

In conclusion people can make their own decisions in life but, people make mistakes in life. people should seek guidance from experts because experts can assist people in situations, making sure that the person is doing it correctly, and give advice to the person that needs help.     ",human
"Having a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall does not sound like a good Idea to me. Since It snows a lot in the winter we would be missing more days of school If winter break was longer. The school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get, which is 2 months. We shouldn't have a break in the fall if we just got back into school after the long summer break.

We should not have a longer winter break. Since it snows a lot in the winter, we miss a lot of school days. Students would be missing lessons, quizes, and even tests because of the snow days we get. Students need to catch up on everything and finish lessons before the school year ends. If we get a longer winter break we would be getting out of school later on which means less summer vacation.

Since the school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get. Students deserve the 2 months of summer break because of all the hard work and studying they did in the school year. In the summer students also get the chance to visit family members, spend more time with their family, and even get ready for the next school year.

Since we just got back into school, It is not necessary to have a one week break in the fall. We just had a 2 month summer break which gave the students the opportunity to be ready for the next school year and also gave them a chance to have a vacation. Since there is also a lot of holidays in the school year, a fall break would interfere with the day we get out of school. Which means we would probably have a little longer school year.

If we did have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, the school year would be pretty short and the students wouldn't like the short breaks. Even though the educators would like it and thinks that it is helpful for students, it would make the students feel stressed out since the school year would probably be shorter.

Having regular summer break, regular winter break, and regular spring break, would be a better idea then having a shorter summer break, long winter break, and a break for spring and fall.",human
"school districts should allow students to graduate one year early but only if they took the courses. If the students willing to sacrifice their time, elective course, and really work to get to their goal of graduating a year early then they deserve it.

From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening theyre putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because:

it could impress the collages they'd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time

It would also be a great benefit for students who'd join the work force instead of collage because:

they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work they'd have a head start on their life

The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year.

in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.",human
"Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"" I think that what there trying to say is that no matter how mad you are or sad you can still find happiness or hope even if you lost someone in a family member it is ad but also just be a little happy that he is in a better place that he dose not have through any pain or suffering.

Aesop said, No act of kindness,""no matter how small is ever wasted"".

Maybe you can be wrong but learn from your mistakes and try again.

"Why should someone, tell people what matters in life , or what decisions to take?

Everyone has the opportunity to live however they want by taking the decisions they want , if they have self-reliance , they don't need no one to tll them what to do.

People should make their own decisios, even if they are not sure, because if they are making a mistake they can learn how to do it good, they will feel secure, which is impoirtant to take future decisions, and they can find out what matters in life by themselves.

People make a lot of mistakes in life by taking the wrong decision , but that's not bad , it is just a way to learn hot to do the things rigth, a lot of people look for experts when they have to take a important decision, because they are afraid of take the wrong decision, and there's nothing bad with it, but they should trust themselves before pay someone else to tell them what to do , or what decisions take.

When people take the rigths decisions by themselves they feel secure about what are they doing ,so they earn self-reliance to make future dedcisions, and even if people don't take the rigth's decisions , they learn from the mistakes, to take the corret decision in the future, with no help from the experts.

Why should someone else tell people what really matters in life ? People don't need guidance to find it out , they should take tehir time to analyze what really matters in life , they should take their own decisions about what matters , because people is different one from others , so they should take their decisions about what really matters in their lifes.

In conclusion people should take their own decisions ,because it helps them to feel secure when taking future decisions, they can learn from the wrongs decisions , and they can learn and understand what matters in life.",human
"What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isn't bad because their no one to rely on. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project.

Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself.

Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same.

Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and can't get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands.

In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.",human
"The use of technology has spread all over the world. Everyone uses technology to talk to family/friends, text family/friends, pay bills online, shop online, etc. To me technology has both positive and negative effects. The positive effect is talking to people you can't see everyday or can't see at all, you can use technology to talk to long distance. A negative effect is the lack of getting stuff done, going outside for fresh air, no person to person communication, etc.

Instead of going outside to be with friends, family, etc most people stay home and just be on there phone all day, watching TV, on the computer, any device people have at home they use. Shopping has changed dramatically. Instead of going to the mall to go shopping most people can just stay home and go online to shop. Paying for bills or going to your bank has changed dramatically. You can pay all your bills, funds, credits, online. Everyone used to get out of there house and go to where they need to go to pay there stuff off, but technology as made it easier for people to stay home an do stuff online.

Half the people in the world think technology is not okay and should be gone. Young kids having technology is even worse because, kids dont play outside anymore they stay inside and play video games, talk to there friends online, watch videos, etc. Teen's are the same too. Almost every teen stays home and talk to friends, play video games like x box, PlayStation, etc. In schools teachers use websites to help students learn and understanding the subject.

Technology has changed the world. Technology does allow people to complete many tasks without talking to people. The world would have been so different if there was no technology made at all. Everyone would be outside more with there friends/family, traveling is the best way to get your mind off stuff and to have fun, eating in restaurants with people you love is the best. Ways to plan stuff out like traveling or eating with friends/family is either using a phone or just talking about it in person.

In conclusion, i think the limitation of human contact has a negative effect. Since technology has been made people have been getting lazy and lazy by the day. Theirs so much things we used to go outside for, we can just stay home and go online. Instead of playing with friends outside we stay home and play video games and if we're bored we stay home and just find something in our device to entertain us. Its hard for people to get there phone taken away from parents because what can we do without our phones? The world needs to see that something is wrong.",human
"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book,

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

"Likewise, many people belive that "" Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.

Firstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.

Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.

Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.

In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",human
"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? Yes, people using technology on everyday bases can have negative effects on thier lives. For example, looking into your screen for long period of time can have negative effects on your eyes. Being on your phone everyday limits your time of socialing and having regular converstion with other people. technology can make you develop an ediction with your phone, video game, and computer making you unawere with what's happeing around the world. eventhoght technology has negative effects on you, sometimes technology can have positive effects on you and your everyday life.

For example, technology can help you keep and complite taskes in your everyday life. using your phone can alow you to do things like: order clothes, buy eddibles, talk with family and friends all over the world, watch movies, listin to music, playing games, remembering birhdays, and things you have to do in your long term plan. Getting things done just by your phone can make your life easier and stress free. In some cases technology is used more then to just watch movies and remebering birthdays, its used to save lifes and make new inventions.

For instance, older people with health problems use technology everyday, they depend on technology to safe thier lives. The technology that they have can alert and get the help the person needs without the person having to call or touch anything. people around the worls are using technology to help and make cure for people with health issues. some are using technology to make new inventions such as, self driving cars to make the world a better and safe place.

For students technology is very helpful they can use it in school to take tests, quizes, and classwork. They can use it at home to do homework and study. use it to reserch and watch visualy watch videos to help them understand things they don't know. help them communicate with teachers and other helpful resorces online. For home schooled students technology is very helpful, beacuse some student are able to learn and understand better if they got lessons online than in a classroom.

Moreover, technology is a very helpful thing it might have negative effects on you and your life if you use it in the wrong way but its very helpful in some cases, and people actually need technology to learn and live. Therefore, technology can benifit people in thier everyday life. technology isnt bad or have negative effects on you its the way you use technology.",human
"Many people say how wonderful it is that much can be done if we are always doing something. But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then would've never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we would've never had what we have now.

Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people would've been inactive. Everything that we built and invented would'nt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably would've been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there would'nt be any people working or there would'nt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We would've been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future.

We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose.",human
"As a teen every one have different opinion on what to do in high school year. In some societies, student are expected to identify to a career by the time they enter high school. I agree that is good idea for student to commit to a career at a young age.

Is the best option for student to commit at a young age for there career in high school. The Student could be more expert in their own career when they young. They could be much better and more expert when they keep doing there job every day at work. Also, they could get payed even more for working with the company they like. Even is fun for them to work because they give them the option to what to do in their career.

If teen start their courses they will have to try hard to reach their career. they have to be tested how they do if they are in their real job. If teen fails that means that they will not do good in their real job so they have to try again so they could could pass and go to their real job. thats good because you still young and you could still work and make more money then others. So that good to start their career when you young.

Some teens disagree that is a good idea for student to commit to a career at young age. Teens say's that student have to look for more career if they don't have one. while some say's that Teen will start doing there career as soon as possible when they study their own career in high school. Starting your career young is the best for money, you could make more money as you get older. Also, starting your career young is the best for your life. when you get old you will have to quite your job because you will not be quick, and knowing what to do.

as a result, this is important for teen to start their career in high school because they could start doing there career a soon as possible. Teen start there courses they will have to try hard to reach their career. teen could be more expert at their career. This is my opinion to teen. All teen need to start their career in high school for better life, more money, and better for the company you work for.                    ",human
"Should your School have Extending Hours in a Day ?

Your School should have long hours because student will have four-day week out of school ;Therefor, students will get to relax and fished there work and it is a great way to stay away from stress. Seen some business have adopted a four-day work week ,with each-day consisting of ten hours, your school should do so too. The benefits This will have on your school is ; students will have more time to work in class and understand what the teacher is teaching . Also you will have more time to fish your homework over the four - week day . Long school hours are good for the students because they will remember more of the stuff they teach.

Students are told they have and sol and the students are stress because they don't know how to study for it and do there homework at the same time . Also students are worried there grads are going to get messed up. Also whenever the teachers is teaching there going miss out on it .When there are sol student meant fail it .

school should add more hours.

Student are in class and hours are passing by and some student are slow at learning but the teachers are rushing them to give what they have and the teachers dropped there grades down because they didn't fished in the time that was given, therefor, schools should give classes more time needed to fish there work.

Students that are tired dont have enough sleep because of all the homework and the jobs some students have to do in only two week ends and its not enough hours for the students to sleep, therefor,

they need a lot of sleep to stay awake during school days. School should have a four-day week off.

School is a hard place to keep up with . student are sometime stress about school and how much they need to catch up in subject .This is why taking a day off or add extend hour to a school day is import.",human

"Author Ralph Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.

First thing,

be yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what's good , what's bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don't know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.

In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like. If you want to make real the greatest accomplishment, never led the world to change you. ",human
"What would make feel much better in class to work alone or in groups? Would it make you feel better and more productive? Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If you're trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position.

Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time.

When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who can't get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and can't get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about.

Some teachers wouldn't support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isn't very helpful when you need the help you do.

Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.          ",human
"The first thing to consider, is that one person is not going to behave the same way as someone else, and all people are not going to act the way as they did when they were kids. Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever.

These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyone's personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just don't pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different.

For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it.

These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different.

It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they don't know what to do anymore. As log as you are aware of what you are doing, you will know what is best for you.                                       ",human
"Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.

First of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.

Second think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.

Third thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.

so some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.

i'm sure that they have families and have to rest. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.

Every country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.

Family over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.",human
"When I was in elementary school, I've always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Art would help them in life and school. It would help their future. This is why I would like to share this lesson with them.",human
"People and students' have some amazing talents and skills. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time.

When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students' had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin.

Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting.

Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience.

They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.    ",human
"I agree that imagination is more important than knowledge because when you imagine of doing something very important, like for example; you want to be successful in school education to become like a doctor, teacher, artist, or scientist.

Anyone in the world can be a smart and better person by working on a job to study about objects, study about computers like the use of technology and the learning of cybersecurity, and to visualize and gain your experiences on working in any job you want work on by putting effort and using your brain.

For example, you can imagine of becoming a scientist to learn about sceince, like chemicals, plants, experiments, and understanding more information about science and other objects by experiencing things. Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that haven't exist in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything.

All you have to do is believe in yourself and use your imagination like to decide whether invent something particular than the other like building a house, a long bridge, and create like a watch to study about anything and learn more about it, you can invent, create, study anythingby using your imagination by experiencing more about things you want to do when you grow up by using your brain, and knowledge to put more effort into jobs. You can also invent instruments, like an accordion, violin, guitar, and a piano, and you can imagine anything like cool stuff, like being an expert at teaching in school like a teacher, studying science,

being a doctor, a builder to invent or build stuff like buildings, or a manager who is in charge of training any team or an athlete for the next match, by having the ability to use your imagination.

We all know that using your imagination is a better thing to do than using knowledge, like imagining to build, invent, or do anything in your experience by learning more imformation, support, and details about using imagination of doing anything. ",human
"While, some students are distracted others are taking an advantage of it. Although some say that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms. Actually it should be allowed in classrooms,for research purpose and projects during class. by the used of cell phones. We can learn more about any topic, an example of this can be,if the teacher is explaining something and i don't understand instead of asking him. I can go to internet and find out. all the things that i need to learn and with examples. I agree with the assertion of using cell phones in classrooms.

Those who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students can't control it. They also think that cell phones are addictive. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything.

I believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. I said no you don't have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. He said fine. If cell phones are not allowed in classrooms, I could not do my vocabulary, and not only that i improved my skills by researching for good information which is not easy. I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades.

I also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time.

In conclusion,we should all used cell phones in classrooms for research purpose and projects. having in mind that a lot of people will not agree,but cell phones are helpful. They are important. technology is here for us,so we can take an advantage, and use it like it is for our own purpose. cell phones will provide a better understanding to all the students in all schools We should reflect about it, and came up with our own position. If cell phones should be allowed in classrooms,or cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms.",human

"One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""it's too difficult"".

First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.

Second reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.

Final reason is that people end up saying that ""it's to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.

As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.",human
"Technology has a good and bad effects, it allows us complete task without having contact with others. Also just makes things so much easier for us. Technology developed over time so quickly, i remember, i used to had a flip phone but, now there is iphone X. No buttens at all and the face ID. Much as the technology developes the people will be seperated from each other.

Tesla just intreduced Tesla Model X. It has an auto pilot mode. Self driven car. Also they announced they making tunnel just for the auto pilot mode. Elon Musk says ""its much cheaper then the normal tunnel and safer"".

And he mentions on his tweeter ""Working on something"",""flying car picture"". So he is already working on the new tech. It's only 2019, can you imagine how technologies would be in next 10 years?. It will be keep developing and devepoling. It won't stop. We will get to some point, we don't even have too see each other or talk to each other.

Nowadays kids doesn't play outside, they have their IPad, Xbox and PC. Even the babies got IPad. If you give the baby IPad,

the babies would be distracting them selves. It's much easier for the moms too. But some point kinds gets addicted to it. Crying and sometimes they just won't eat anything. Smart phones can be really dangerous to the eyes.

"In my opinion do we accomplish is if we are doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things.

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish.

Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. For example in your job if you are new you need to learn how you gonna your own work and if you do to want to learn you never gonna be good in what you doing or in the school, when i start go to the High School i was scared because I doesn't spoke English but I started to doing something and now I speak is not the most better English but is work.

In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things. ",human
"Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.",human
"Many people success because of their behavior or attitude and how well they do in school or how great they are with other. But having a positive attitude is good because, If you are a positive person other people would like to be around you more, You will feel better and in a good mood most of the time, You could help others do well in work or even if they feel down or without motivation. It also helps in your daily day. A good attitude is great for everyone and it shows the real you.

Having a positive attitude is good for you and others. Many people are depressed and being around someone with a positive attitude makes them feel better and more confident. An example of this is if your friend is going through a hard time and you help him or her or even talk to them positively about the issues they will feel better and even could possibly start getting a better attitude. Just because they getting the support or talk they need by a close friends with a good attitude. So people even feel so much better about them self whenever they talk to someone about their problems. And Having a good attitude is like having a good vibe and people love being around those type of people.

You will feel better with yourself if you are in a good mood. Being positive helps with your mood and they way you see life. If your having a hard time at work or any other ativities such as school, sports or even at home. You could gain motivation on doing those things by having a positive attitude. However this might not work all the time because of all the negative people that is in our world and how people act and treat others now days but it will make sure that you are in track and ready for whatever and it wont really affect you or hurt you.

A positive attitude helps a lot on your daily basic. Let's said you and you wife or husband argue. All you would need to do is think positive like about good memories or moments together. I'm pretty sure if y'all love each other the argument won't really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude.

However, A lot of people would believe that not having a positive attitude is the key to success, They are wrong because a lot of things could happen when you are a negative person. Such as being depressed, losing motivation to do almost anything, making bad decisions, not like being with others, and not liking things you use to do. All this reason could be because of a bad attitude. But soever if you have a positive mood everything would feel so much better and you gonna have better days and other would respect you because of your attitude.

In conclusion having a positive attitude is good for everyone and it makes people life better. Because of the good moods, helping others and yourself, having better days. And it just makes life so much better and easier. No one deserve to be negative or even mean to others. We all created equal and we all live in the same world. So why not just go on and share our positive attitude with others and for we could make our planet a better places for everyone.",human
"I think it is a good idea that some schools have

Four-day work week. because, the schools can save energy and resources like.

food electricity water paper

Does this will help the schools?

First, this can help the schools not to spend Food, Water, Paper, and Electricity. Next, If we have five days of school we are wasting a lot of Food, Electricity, and money. Then, if we have four days of school, we save a lot of money. Finally, with four-day work week it better because, the fifth day of school nobody is in the schools to waste energy and food

. In conclusion, This can saves schools a lot of money.

Why is this a good idea?

First, This can be a good idea because, The Students can sleep more. they will have four days of school. This mean the students will have three days to sleep well. Then, if they add 2 hours more there will be some consequences. If the Students don't sleep well, they will be sleeping in class. After that, they will not do their homework, test, and quizzes. Finally, The Students have to sleep at least 8 hours each night every day. In conclusion it is good to have four day work week.",human
"Is important to learn from other people experiences? The answer is yes, because they don't want you to do the same that they did. In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. They tell you does experiences, because they don't want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life.

Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have. Next, when people tell you their experiences, they want you to do better them what they did. Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life.",human
"I agree with the adoption about the midnight weekend however this did not mean that i agree the 10 p. m weekday curfew.

Although many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger`s that 18 has their own`s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager`s need education, a home and money.

The teenager`s need education, being from elementary until high school grades. In 5 or 10 years in the future the teenager been the support from the economy, the country and the next generation.

A home the teenager`s need a place to call ""home"" that place where him not only can relax, rather he should be tranquil and save from the rest of the world; that place where you know that someone is to waiting for you with a smile and food, sure will be you should reprimand but you know that is for your well-being and future.

Logically the money is the more important fact in the teenagers life, to won it is necessary to get a part-time job or work in the weekend, that is where is the problem to obtain money the teenager`s from 16 to 18 year`s has to use their value time after school to work. The part-times are approximate 6 hours; if a student work from 4. pm to 9p. m there is no problem, but if a student work between the curfew from 5p. m to 10p. m the big problem is that the teenagers will been accused be breaking the law when it did not happen is just a unfairly interference from the city.

In summary: The children`s from today will be the teenager of tomorrow and the adults from the new generation.

a home is the best place to a teenager to feel comfortable, save and tranquil. The money is the most important think for a teenager in the present and for their future and the time is a necessary value to get it.",human
"Big Responsibility Young Age

In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? We'll figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young.

Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor.

You can't know what you want to do in your life even if you haven't live by your self.

I don't think it's a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if it's your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I don't think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.

It's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I

want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.

In conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God.",human
"Yes,I agree failure plays in the pursuit of success. Some people when they fail they learn what they did wrong and next time they fix it. If they don't understand or learn from there mistakes. They can't get success in there life. If anyone did any mistake try to fix it. If you can't fix it. Get help from your family or your friends.

When i was in 9th Grade. I don't like math. Because i don't understand math question. I read my question and find mistakes. What i did wrong. Then i fix my mistakes. I do my work again and again. I do my work very hard. I ask my teacher about anything that i don't understand. She help me lat to learn math. Because i did my work hard now i get the success. Now i am good in math.

When i came in United State. I don't Speak and understand English. I made many mistakes to write the work or speak. I try my best and I learn English from my teachers from my friends. Any word i don't understand i look in dictionary. If i can't find word in dictionary i ask my teachers. I speak English at home with my brother and sister they fix my mistakes and its help me to speak better English.

Some people when they loss they don't try it again. Because they think that we are not good at this. Cause of that they can't get success. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again. like Sport coaches motivate there team before they match. When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. Don't be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that.

Reasons why people fail. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. people need to understand other problems and help them. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better.

When someone break his/her leg. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. because he/she think that it's very painful. Then someone help his/her put his/her hand on the shoulder. Then they slowly slowly put weight his/her leg. Like this you don't need to lose enthusiasm in your life. When you feel failure see other people read about them that how they fight when they fail.

Many American famous people loss in there missions but they don't loss there hope. They try it again and now we are read about them. Because they did many things. Thats help us make easy and fast to do our work or travel. Like Airplane, Electricity, Computers, Cars, and many others things.

Some people fail in there life. They try again but still they fail. So try something else that easy for you and you can make your life better. Like if you are not in a basketball try soccer or baseball. which one is easy for you. Choose that and do hard work on that. practice every day don't be lazy.

I want to say that do what ever do you want to do. But do that you are good in and easy for you. If you like another thing thats hard for you. do hard work on it and make easy for you. Don't lose enthusiasm. how this world work? help others then they will help you not all ways.",human
"Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. For an example when

I was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me what's up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didn't surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach.

After a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. But it was the final game everything changed the team we went up against had stronger and bigger players they first took out are running back with a neck injury so that left me playing two positions. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me.

He asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i wen't back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up.

Coach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday.

How do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it. ",human
"DISTANCE LEARNING

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.",human
"Well I think we should always be doing something because it take your mind off of other things in your head. We can accomplish more if we are doing something like people have accomplished a lot within the years and look where we are now. We could be farther but some people are always lazy and don't like doing nothing. Those people gotta get out of there house and do something for that world each person can change the world a little but at least they are doing something.

The most greatest people that lived or lives on this world have done amazing stuff and it's not because they are sitting down in their couch eating and watching tv,it's because they are out their learning more and doing more for us the people so we can have a better future and I want to do the same thing so I can give my children a better future and a better life. Think of it this way if they are building a skyscraper do they only put a group of five people to do the work NO right they are gonna but hundreds of people because ""much may be done if we are all doing"".

What Thomas Jefferson said is true we can do more if we all but our part but there are people that don't want to do nothing but that is ok because there is people out there that is putting more effort then some of us. Imagine if the whole world doesnt do nothing for a whole day where would our economy go to or our community they would collapse. If we all do our work imagine how our economy would go and how our community would improve if we would all do something our world would be a better place for all people and animals. For right now more people our doing their part than people that are not because if more people are not doing nothing than people that are doing something then this world would have collapsed already.

If your are a person that is always putting in their part you will recieve more than the people that dont do nothing. Look life is a test full of choices the choices are what define you and what you have done and they will define you your whole life and your choices may be better for the people or not but if their not the chose wisely next time because choices can change the world like chosing to do something or not. Its not bad to not doing nothing your not doing damage to no one all i'm tryna say is that your help could help the community and the world so don't be afraid to do something and dont be ashamed of doing something and failing be ashamed of not trying.",human

"Did you know that Robotics is the most funnest job than any other jobs out there? what I like to pursue is doing Robotics because it's all about coding and building.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you. Building is like Lego, but you have to screw in nuts, and not connecting them together like plastic bricks. Also, building the robot is most important, because if you screw something up, you have to remove every part of the robot to fix that one mistake you did.

"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my .",human
"Everyone chooses their own character no matter if you are small or big. A persons character is based on their personality. Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character.

We choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. Some people dont have a good character and that's why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. A coworker of mine was very rude to customers. He was always mad therefor no other employees wanted to talk to him. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job.

We choose our character based on how we dress. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job. A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasn't sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didn't fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character.

We choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality.

Some people say that we can't choose our character because it's beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. Most people that we don't know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and don't be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people it's hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not.

"The misnister of

Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee it's a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't explow your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",human
"Im disagree with extending the school day, because we pass the half off the day in the school and the people won't like that because they want to have time on the rest of the day and do what they like to do.

That is why I am disagree with extending the day of school because we are not going to be able to do what we want to do on the day,If the school add more hours to the school is not going to be good because will be sad because they can't do what they want to do on the rest of the day.

They will be mad at the school because the school will and late and don't have time to do anything because is we get out late of the school and the time that we get home are's parent wont let us have fun and they will send us to bed.

That is why the people won't like a extra hour of school because we are not going to gave fun and we wont be able to do anything about sport.

So that is why we dont what to have extra time of school because it can be boring because we only do homework and we don't go a out side we don't like extra time in the school.",human
"Should students enjoy less summer vacation and more winter break. Why would they change the vacation time? Cant it just stay the same as usual? Would the students like like that change? Are those changes going to help the students in their studies?

First of all some students wont like this change because,in the winter time it can get really cold ,so the students wont be able to go outside,walk,nor play. Also one of the reasons they wouldnt like the change is that i summer break they can be outside and go out places. In the winter could get really cold and the students stay outside for a long period of time they might get a could and miss some school days and affect them. If they miss schools days they will be behind from the class.

In the other hand some students might like that idea because in the summer time it can get really hot outside .If its really hot outside people can get dehydrate ,but for other reasons summer days can be some amazing days. Some benefits of summer : going to the beach,amusement park,camping,and travel. Reasons that students will like to have more summer vacation:more vacations days,nice weather to go outside, go to the pool,explore nature and helps them to stop using technology.

If this change in vacations happen I wont like it,because I like being outside in warm weathers and i woulld hate to have less summer break and more winter break .Plus I hate when we dont have school when theres a snow s day. I

like how the vacation time is right now because everyone can enjoy some vaction in the tie that the like the best . I am aslo sure that most of the student will like to keep the same time of vacations beacuse they want to have more not less

In conclusion the time of vacation will not change because the students will prefer to keep the same one .They will like to enjjoy the time not hate it. My point is if the studdent dont like the new time they will problobly wont like to g back to school and just ingnore it. So if they want to change the time talk to the student if they are ok with it ,if not then make a solution about it.        ",human
"Failure is a simple thing that everyone use to get. some people are loss of enthusiasm but some people they do not by keep trying. In my mind I agree with "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" this is very important thing that we might think about, The reason why I agree whit this statement be cause of failure brings me a improvement, success.

I always improve myslef when I get a failure. Last year, I was in high school in New York, it was my first year for studying in America. because it was my first time so I fail a tasting so many tests, I could not talked to any friends and I also could not made friends. everything were so hard for me to pass or event talking whit someone, so I keep continued stady more English skill. Right now a year pass, my English is batter than first time that I got here.

Failure make me stronger and bring me success. I got a lot of problems last year, so

I was thinking about go back to Thailand but I always tell myself ""don't give up Generic_Name,you can try it again, you can do it, you will get it"" and I believe myself. I did not go back to Thailand and I got a lot of new things make myself stronger.

the Failure is important role in life. We get success form leaening from our makestake, we improve everytime that we fail. If we give up and walk away from our failure,than we are just a losser.        ",human
"Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that ""sucess consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiam and basically its asking me if i agree on it.

Basically i really have never heard about this prompt but i find it reallu intersting and would love to know more about it, I feel like if there were to ask me an a public place for example now but instead a public place and read about it more and even just reading a little bit about it makes me agree on it.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that ""sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams""which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong.

May not be true for many people but for sure for me,I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all , its always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tuff for many to accept it but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings.

However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldnt make it not even how hard i try to i wasnt gonna make it out of the dark place i was in and eventually i told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all i was going to do is fail all over again , I didnt have no type of enthusiam whatsoever was horrible and all i did everyday was loss my enthusiam more and more until one day i got back up like a normal day and said to myself that ""Life doesnt get easier you only have to get stronger' and i realized so much at that moment i wouldnt even believe myself that i was up like nothing and day ago i was not in the right mindset thinking i was a completely failure and even didnt have enthuasiam for nothing. so last i would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize alot and a very true saying of course,                              ",human
"Each school study more that one hundred students. Many students in high school took not much hard subjects, most of them are art and music .

Also, what about teachers? Does this subject will be intresting to students to study? Does they will have time to explain students, what they study? Teacher need some time to be ready for topic that give school to student. Also need explane this on lesson and after lesson, if student don't undestand this on the lesson.

"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of student's struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff you're interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home.

I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so it's more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When student's get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if you're sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop you'll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades.

However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on.

That is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school.  ",human
"High school students should graduate in three years instead of traditional four years. Most student who follows this plan should work hard and take more courses in the summer or in the evening. Therefore, students will have a good choice to work one year early or to enter the college early. Students will finish high school early, work force one year early, achieve their goals early. These reasons are why high school students should graduate in three years instead of traditional four years.

Firstly, students have a good idea to finish high school early. For example, some students take a courses during the summers and some of them take courses during the evenings. When students take the courses during summer and in the evening, students will finish school early. In addition, some students may not be able to take elective courses. When student not taking elective courses, they will finish high school one year early. when students finish high school early, they will have time to achieve their dreams.

Secondly, students will have time to work force one year early. For example, some students work hard for saving some money to pay the college. When students enter the college, they need money to pay the college for the courses which they will taking it. Therefore, some students like to finish high school early for to have time to work one year early. When students work hard and saving money for college, they will study without any worried about the money that should pay to college.

Most importantly, students will have time achieve their goals early. For example, some students want to achieve their goals earl, for to have a good career. When students achieve their goals, they will have a good life in the future, and they will have a jobs or career to support their life. In addition, students who achieve their goals early, they will opportunity to achieve another goals. When students achieve another goals, they will make a future more better.

Some people argue that high school students should not graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. They say students will not be able to take elective courses. This may be true; however, when students will not be able to take elective courses, they will achieve their dreams early. In addition, when students graduate early they will have time to working and saving money for college. In fact, students will have a good choice to work one year early or to enter the college early.

In conclusion, students have a good idea to finish high school early, have time to work force one year early, and students will have time to achieve their goals early. These reasons are why students should graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Some students take a courses during the summers and some of them take courses during the evenings, for graduate early. Some students work hard for saving some money to pay the college.

"Some may say that working in a group is better because you have people around you that can help you and support you. You dont have to depend on anyone when your working by yourself. Your focused more and when your focused no one can distract you. You could ask people for help if your confused on something.

You don't have to depend on anyone when working working alone because if you have a group and one of your group members doesn't show up then your screwed because now your missing a piece of your project or whatever the situation is. It's going to be hard when working by yourself because everything is depending on you. So you have to do everything on your own.

When your working by yourself you are more focused on doing the work. You could listen to music to keep you even more focused. Music keeps you relaxed and calm.

"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding,

or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

Thank you.",human
"i would take the offer of finish high school early and stay after school because they giving a chance to finish early so you might just take it you get to go to college early and probably get a full time job get you're own money and not worry about not having money no more.

It is a good idea because some people would like to finish early then late some of them would rether get a job then come to school but you need education to get a good job and be succsesfull in life and a better job gets you good money for the people that like to spent money on clothes and stuffs like that

A lot of kids dropping out ofschool why because like i said they rather get a job then go school but you need school to get a good job but they giving you the oportunity to graduate early but some kids just guve up on school and drop out of school but i would take the oportunity to finish school early so i can be succesfull in life and have a better life and not worry about not having money.

But some students wouldnt like to come during summer or after school so they would have to ask all the studets so they can agree to see what they prefer to do like just take the classes the you really need for graduation insted oftaking classes that you dont need for graduation so they wouldnt have to stay after school or come during summer ",human
"I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and it's just to much forus kid's or grown ups.

Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you can't go outside cause it's to dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school. That's reason #2.

Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you can't do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause it's to late and dark. That's reason #3.

Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you can't go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. That's reason #4.

I get it if yall school's set extra time in school just to make us smart,or have a good life,and a good job,but us kid's and adult's need time for are own self so this is all my reason and example's that I disagree for having extra time in school. ",human
"i am disagree with this because, is going to have a negative effect because, you are going to lose the comunication with the people.

first reason: you can't go out side to shop.

example:when i was in my country, i was going to the store, i was go in my bike or walk but when i move to the united states i don't need to go because, my mom just call to the store and they bring the prouct or food.

second reason: play games with your friends.

example: the last week, i ask to one of my friend who live in my home country if they continue play games like soccer in the soccer field or anther game in the street , he tell that now they play populars games in the phone and they don't like play games in the street enymore.

third reason: the little boys don't want to do others thing just stay in the phone.

example: my little brother who is to years old, he just want to watch videos on the phone, when my mom take the phone he cry because he want to watch videos or play games on the phone he don't do other things, he don't play with my other brother.

fourth reason:

go to visit family or other places.

example:when i go to visit my family or other places i can leave my phone because everytime we go to visit my family i be bored. and when wi go to visit new places i like to take pictures of the place.

fifth reason: you will be a addicted with your phone or computer.

example: i have a friend here in the school who use the phone in the class, sometimes he is play games , some times he watch videos, when the teacher look at him he is in the phone she tell him to put on his packet or in the back pack but he never do it, some times he sit on the back of the room so the teacher can't see him.

"No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.

Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. She's in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain.

Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.

Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didn't used to hurt like it used to before all the time, that's why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but it's good for their health.

Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.

"One school activity that kids enjoy are field trips because it provides them a brake from school work and it gives them a opportunity to explore their surroundings. Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.

Middle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.

Schools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.

In conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.          ",human
"I chose the lesson math for elementary school because. It can help out a lot,it makes number more easier when going on to middle school,it can make your intelligent bigger. When knowing your numbers or knowing how to do math it makes math seem really easy. When moving on later in life you dont have to keep on struggling because you will already know how to overcome prices because you been practicing math all your life. It pays off if you keep on doing math and practicing it over and over. When moving on to middle school or high school you have to already know your steps math setups or your going to have a hard time in middle school and high school. Plus you will have good grades in math all the time and your test score will be good as well. I will always do math because i know later in life math will be every where you go and plus learning this in a young age will help you out a lot and it make a really smart person If you really keep on. Math will be every where you go and sometimes you have to do math when your in the store, gas station, when your buying stuff online,

even when your buying a gift for someone. Learning how to do math will help out a lot. I know sometimes it will get boring or you will get bored of it but just knowing how to do math it will help you and save your life in college. Because in college your going to see some pretty big numbers and math problems. Math will be important in so many ways because in life your going to use a lot of math so its better learning it when your young. So then you dont have to worry about it so much later on in life. This is why math is an important lesson for elementary students.",human
"do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?.I say that it should be an elecitve because some peole are taking it as electives and so they cahn graduate on time thats why i say they should make theses classes go for elecitives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. more than core classes cause core classses are required for gradutaion and the elecitves are for fun and i think that the school should give these classes as an elecitve because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at.

some people may believe that you should take a music class,or art class,or drama class however; i believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important then the core classes. but at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. and so you expiernce something new. and you get to meet new and differnt people and thats why it should be an elective.",human
"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons.                                   ",human
"You know what I want to accomplish? I

want to be a soccer player. I want to play for my own country and I want to be recognized when I play soccer. It would be really fun to play,train,play championships and play in big events like the World Cup.

I want to play soccer for Mexico because Mexico is a good team and they have good tactics on how to play the game more inffiencetly and they have good strategies. I want to represent my country when I play because I am representing myself and to the people in Mexico. The team I want to play for have many games such as friendly games. Friendly games is a game of fun not to compete but to have fun.

If we want to get better we have to practice and after practice we want to play games. We want to practice to get better and stronger. In practice we learn things that we have no idea what to do or we want to learn about it. After practice we want to get into games and play. We play to learn so that if we lose we get to see where we made our mistakes. We learn those mistakes by learning it so that it won't happen again.

Sometimes we don't just play friendly games. We play championships to win trophies. We play in knock out stages which if we win, we go to the next round and if we lose we get knocked out of the championship. We work hard to get trophies. Every game we play in that is a part of championship wise we compete and work very hard to win this trophy and we try our best to win.

Every four years we play in a big event called the World Cup and we compete to earn a trophy that is made out of all gold. We have to qualify to enter so we have to play a game to enter. If we win we get into the World Cup, but if we lose we don't get to play. Sometimes we play in leagues and we have to be first in the stage to get the trophies. We sometimes win but other times we don't. ",human
"Some schools offer programs for students graduate in three years? students needs to go school for learn and be success in life in high school normally is four years but some schools give to students some programs for to graduate in three years. a lot people think four years on school is good because in that years you can take to much classes. I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college

Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects.

Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student .

Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good.

Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .",human
"What do you prefer, keep eating food that do not help you or food that is good for your body? Eat healthier food make your body stronger and helps you to be in good form. I think a change of the lunch menu, could be a good idea.

In my soccer team, I have practice everyday, after school. Sometimes

I don't feel good to practice,

because the food was not heath to my body or it wasn't enough. My team mates told me that they bring their own food because the lunch menu of the school do not like them, and they are tired to eat the same food every single day

Some students have to go out to buy healthier food.

Another reason why the lunch menu should be change is because an healthier lunch, keeps you awake and with energy. Some student need to eat health because they are in school teams. Also, sometimes you feel tired when you are studying. you feel that your stomach hurts and feel that something is wrong with your body, you feel sleepy, sometimes hungry, and you can not concentrate in the class. For example, I have Personal Fitness on my last period, when I eat my regular lunch menu, I feel tired and sometimes I don't want to do anything because I feel my body too heavy. My doctor, told me that I have to eat healthier. Since, when you are growing up, your body needs food that help it.

A change of the school menu could be beneficial for all of us. An healthy body, stronger, and with good aptitude. Our health, depends on all of you. Let's make a change, for the future of all our children. Let know to the principal of all the benefits that This change will bring.                ",human

"Busch Gardens is one place that I would like to visit. I think it is the perfect place where I should go. I want to go there because it is fun, all the rides, and I had never visit their before.

First of all, it is fun to go Busch Gardens. I heard that their are some good games that I can enjoy. My friends told me that are a lot of good shops for shopping. If I ever go their I would spend all my savings on buying games and toys. The best thing in their is I can spend time with my family.

Next, I would love to try all the rides. The first thing I would like to do in there is to ride the biggest roller coaster. I would love to try every single ride that is in their. Those rides are probably fun than any other thing. Then I would get in the horror house and scare my sister. Afterward, I would get in that maze and try to solve it.

Finally, the last reason is it is the place that I never visit before. I really want to go there because I just heard about it from my friends and other peoples. I think it is a good place to visit with my family. All my friends always recommend me to go their. They said that it is a great place for me to visit in the world.

"Have you always wondered how your parents accomplished what they have for your future, How famous people like for example singers and world wide company's became so influential to the world. Well Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Now when you think about it, is it beneficial if your always doing something or do you think inactivity also serves a purpose?

In my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. You can't accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something you'll be able to accomplish what you want.

My number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. They even left their home country so I can have a better life here, They never stayed idle even until this point and they've gotten pretty far.

Second example would be singers, In this day in age believe it or not singers have great influence in this world. That's because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing. They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. Like Micheal Jackson, Even when he sadly died to this day people still praise him for what he made in the pop music world. Or Snoop Dog and his ability to rap really fast which people gave him the title of rap god. There's a lot more people that have changed the world because of music but I think they had the highest impact.

Now the last example is company's and their founders per say. Car company's, or company's in general had or have someone who started it all, One big example would be Ellon Musk and his Tesla car company. After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. His made commuter vehicle and now his focusing on diesel trucks so there can be less pollution in the air and more safety for the drives. His making a lot of impacts in the world because his not just standing around waiting for someone else do it for him. I think I've said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote.

"Succes come from failure without loss enthusiasm. Success does not come as a easy as a it sounds, succes comes from har work and failures.

Succes is not somethig everyone can reach specally without fails and enthusiams. Fail mades people stay down but people decide if yhey want to be down or work harder until they success.

Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best soccer playes in all the world. When he begins his soccer correar ,he was seen as a normal soccer player, he fail some many times. There were soccer games when he did not score any goals or his team loss. His enthusiasm made him work harder and harder. Hard work made him the person who he is now, he is considered by so many people the best soccer player of all the history but is wasen't easy, fails made him work harder in order to success in his correar after 15 years he keep working hard to be succefully in life.

Enthusiam made people work harder until they reach succes. Enthusiam is the feeling that makes people go foward even they fail multiple times. When people have the type motivation fail is just a symple word becuase most of the people want to keep trying until they finally succes in life.

My mom is a good example , a few months ago she was trying to get her Driver Licence Permit. In order to get it she had to took a test that consist about all the rules in the road. She fail the first time, she was sad beucause she could not get her permit but she had a big motivation inside her that impulsed her to go and retake the test again. She fail the test twice , she never give up she worked hard to pass the test. She did not tooked the test 3 or 4 times, she toked 5 times until she finally passed the test and she got her permit, months later she go her Driver license. She fail so many times but she never give up. When you want to succes does not matter how many times you fail, you most get up work hard until you succes . As you can see, succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.",human
"The limitation of human contacted due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people. It prevents the young generation of today basis social skills. It allows bulling on the internet. It also allows trolling on the internet.

First, Technology interferes with student social skills. For example, the student walks into the class room they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. In the class room the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others.

Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. I saw a video on YouTube.

A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue.

Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example

Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020.

The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends with out our phones. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they can't use their phones during class. So on bulling last longer and that goes beyond the internet so in conclusion should be more stricter, technology limits people talking about their issues.                     ",human
"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like they've had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path.

When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career.

Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they weren't good enough didn't just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. They've taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, they've given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts.

However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.",human
"Do we get astonished when people behaviors change over time? This makes us surprised and wonder because of their first impressions to us. I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. People changes all the time just like how the world moves every second. First impressions are possible to change. A behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. A person's character is similar to how a pregnancy grows. When a woman is pregnant, you may be unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show.

People hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want.

In today's world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in modern societies. Needs are the most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. In the movie, a man named Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldn't cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he meets the first time. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family. You see how poverty makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time.

Sometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change.

Marriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. No one gets married to his or her nemesis so bad pressures from our partners affect our characters. Depression makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Two years ago, I met a girl called Generic_Name. She was so isolated and sad. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesn't mean that is how they are. People change all the time.

Peer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level.

You will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail and every teacher wants to be awarded by the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time.

""Every coin has two faces"" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them. How a person behaves the first time you meet them may change all the time. And if we understands how the world is moving every seconds we all going to get peace!                ",human
"I believe that people whom value their self, should be guide for a person who they admire, so they can look at them like a great example to follow and hopefully one day be like them or better.

People always make mistakes even though when some times we don't admit it, no matter how good we are on something people always need help we can not always do things by our own. we always require someone to tell us that we are doing wrong .

Even in some circunstance we need to grow up and believe and our self, that we have the capacity like everyone else, to make our dreams comes true even when things goes wrong, that does not mean anything is just a challenge that we need pass to make us strongers.

However, just for being clear doing things by your own is fine, but if we have the incredible disponibility to have someone always there for you who you trust in. I think is the safe way to go because todays days those person whom use to give you advice and support you rarely appear, so do the best person you can and remember ask for help is just an option to help you out and improve the best of you.",human
"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do.

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.         ",human

Their is no reason what will their reaction be to me back in the day , they didn't know what the older students and younger students react i bet they pray for the older students and younger students to get along on the first day of school, to see their reaction. What i think is it will be normal the effects like they will get use to it and they will mine they old busness plus to me they will say we gonna have to treat the younger students the same like everybody else . The older students have to assist the younger students, to do service hours or get credit on service and to do more and more service hours. The older students are having bad grades in classes , their teacher will get a student who is really smart to be the older student twoder.",human
"I don't think its fair to change the policy.

What if the students were close to have an a grade or b ? We all are trying are best and for you gust to come and change the policy. students are even going to have worse grades. Because them thinking that they could only be in a sport if they have an a or b . And them trying there best to bring grades up and have more points! ITS NOT fair.

I say you just leave the things the way it is! Kids are going to do better in school and bring there grades up. But if you just come and take those sports away trust me its not going to be so good at all! Guys are going to argue about soccer and foot ball. Girls are going to argue about there sports and there not going like it.

Leave everything the way you think is best but there not going to like it and the scores are going to down. And your not going to like the way everything is going to be.",human
"When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but your group work more than the rest of the class do you think it's fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self-esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praising when the student make your best effort.

For example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't worry about his project. Some students are more lazy than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort.

However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize student's work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students.

In conclusion the teachers only need recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Student's with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.",human
"churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. I think that churchill's is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure.

Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Lets say that student that goes to school that they don't want to succeeded in there education. That they don't want there education for college or a university if they don't succeeded . Another example is if you are not succeeding then you can't do something just as outcome.

Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise.

Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They don't want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired.

Iin conclusion Winston churchhill's is a failure of the plays in the pursuit because not many people are failure that who want to success and many people are inspired from want there are going and finally so many people are pursing to failure.",human
"Ralph Waldo once wrote,""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow.""I agree with this quote because of my experience learning another language like English it can be hard to learn English coming from a Hispanic family,and video gaming. Some may disagree with the quote because there is nothing else to learn .

When I was in first grade I came to school not knowing any English. Honestly I felt isolated because the language barrier I did not know what the teacher was telling me. All I said was ""Yes"" and ""No"" thats all I knew. I think it was a few weeks later that they call my parents . They notify my parents that

I was not doing well in school. My mother as always told me practice makes perfect. My mother with little bit of English that she knew she helped me to perfect it. Now, I could speak both languages fluently because of that effort I have more opportunities for a better job .

In Christmas the year 2017, I got the probably the best and worst gift of my life. It was an X box one at first felt happy because it was my second gaming console, but I did not know how to use it. It took me two weeks to understand the full operation. Then when I starting playing the first game that I bought was Fifa 18 by the way I did not pay for the game it was my dads credit card.

After that I downloaded Fortnite it was free so I didn't get in trouble . I found the games difficult , I started to practice a lot , then a few weeks later it became an addiction. I couldn't focus in school my grades were falling off where I had them before I got the X box one. My father told me if I did not get better grades he be forced to take away . So I started to focus on my grades ,but yet still thought the gaming console .

Some may disagree that what Ralph Waldo wrote. For example, if your'e a teacher you probably know what to teach for the semester. The job you have does not require that much only a master degree. Or being a car washer you just clean cars.

This has been all I have for this quote.       ",human
The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness shoudn't be wasted because They wan't everyone to be kind like they say no act of kindness should never be wasted. They wan't everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My oppinoion I wold at least do one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. If you do a act of kind ness you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. It is nice to do in genral. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. You can make someone day because they might have had A bad day and you gave them a complment and that make them feel good. I think the auther made this becuase they can make people feel good. The ancinent greek is relly old and they were doing alot of act of kind ness. The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness no act of kind nees shoud never be wasted no matter how small. I think Aesop is a ancient greek king That can tell people to do act of kind ness. He said in his words NO! act of kind ness should never be wasted for no small reason I think that means that evreyone should do a serten amont of acts of kind ness a day like I said that I woud do do like one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy.

"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day.      ",human

We were played soccer and they told me that i'm so good for soccer they like the way that i play it. Now every where when they see me they say to me '' hey you play really good for real ''. so here is the conclucion. People never going to forget the firts impression that they get from you those people still remember me the time goes fast i didtn meet them for a year and half and the impression still stay that they think that im really good for soccer .Some people say that impression can be change not matter if is good or bad impression but you gotta work really hard for it and its going to take a long time.",human
"Thomas Jefferson wrote determine never to be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, people can accomplish if we are always doing something, people can follow his purpose what they want because all people can done with want they accomplish in ours life its many things that can we do something.

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve. So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do.

"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.         ",human
"Some schools have a program that pairs older students with younger students.

I think this program is good idea for the students because it will help them work together . And it will be good for them so they can be able to learn from each other.

Therefor it will help teachers to be able to get there work done at that time. It will also help there teachers.

For the younger students it will help them learn from the older students and there younger friends. It will also help them in school too to be able to listen to there teachers and there families. It will help them to get smart in school, Help one other, under stand from each other and anchor each other. There for it help there grades get battler.

"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.

Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen.

Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate.

A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school.

with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",human
"Elective Classes

I believe that classes like arts, music and drama should be elective to the studnets. It is not required for every students to take every classe. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. Instead of forcing students to take every classes, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in.

Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. Schools where they allow students to choose classes they want are likable. Students prefer to go to that school where they can choose classes as they want. They don't prefer to go to those schools where the students are forced to take every classes. If students are to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle.

I believe that it is a waste of time to force those students to take classes they are not interested in. It is not only a waste of time for students, but it is a waste of time for teachers who works so hard. If a person is not interested in something, you should not force them to like it. Classes like music, art and musics are extra activites. They are important for us but not that important where studnets have to be forced to take every classes. If students are to take every classes, they might loose interest in that particular class they were interested in.

Instead of forcing students to take every class, it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the studnet is interested in. Studnets might like only one class and has a talent on that particular class, they should be allowed to take that particular class and does not have to take other classes. If a student does not want to participate in any particular class because of their personal reasons, schools should not force them to take those classes.

It is not that classes like arts, music and drama are not important to students. They are important and we should not neglect thoses classes. But the studnets should also not be forced to take every classes. Students should have their own rights to choose what classes they want and what they don't want. If they have to take every classes, it might be too much for them to handle. I believe that it is better to give importance to that one particular class that the student is interested in, than to force them to take every class. As it is a waste of time to both teacher and student",human
"The Negative Effects Of The Technology On People's Lives.

Technology helps people to preform many things hence, classes online, shop and communicate with others. I believed that technology has negative effects on people's lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Also technology had changed our style of lives; People used to visit parks to talk with other. Families do not spend time together. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Now everything had changed due to this issue.

One reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that now some stores closed because people do not shop in this stores anymore. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. For example I recently heard about two store named STORE_NAME and STORE_NAME. They have this issue due to the use of technology. STORE_NAME is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. This stores are on sale of everything to close right away because

Fewer people visit this stores. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter.

Another reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. People decide to stay at home playing video games, and buying online.

Some people think that technology is a better way to express themselves. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing.

Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. When the teacher ask them questions related to the topic, they do not know what to answer due to the technology.

In the other hand Some people will argue about technology has positive effects on our style of lives. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However technology limited us to express our ideas with no need of a cell phone device . Also it had destroyed our culture. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology. Example, My cousin is in the middle school he played Fourtnite everyday. He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. He always is with his cell phone playing. I believe that the life is so short to waste.

In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. everything in this world is going to be different. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness.        ",human
"Many people thinks that the school should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending school two hours.    ",human
"One way to improve student achievement is to create a homework club. I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time,

less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.

First, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.

Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home i'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. if i joined a club like that i'd be happy because i wouln't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.

Furthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now.

Next, Homework clubs and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. I

believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that.

Finally, I think creating a homework club is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this club.

Sincerely,

"Former British Minister Winston Churchill once said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Many people are not perfect and fail, and some think failure is bad. Failure is actually good, because it teaches you what was wrong. Although some people may think that failure does not play a role in success, it should be known that failure dose play a role in success.

One of the reason failure plays a role is that people can learn from their mistake. when people fail they can find out what went wrong instead of giving up, Another reason is failure makes people stronger. A lot of times failure may cause people stress, and stress makes people strong and not give up. Also failure helps people become better people. leaning from there failure.

Although some people think incorrectly that failure do not play a role in success it should be know that it dose play a role in success, because you can lean from your failure, failure makes you stronger, and failure makes you a better person. people should not give up when they fail, they should learn and try again until they succeed.

"Determine to do not be idle is hard because we do not imagine us doing something if we never do it because we are very idlest to do it. We do not imagine how wonderful can be if we never do it.

Lets say that you want to be a soccer player, but you are so idlest to do it, like you are imagine that you are the best soccer player of the world, you earn a millions of millions of dollars with a lot of girls around you and a lot of fame. How you want to accomplish that if you are so idlest to do start doing it. If yo want to be the best soccer player of the world that you imagine in your mind, wake up 6 or 5 am and start practicing and running and training your body and do not be a slacker lying in your bed imagine something that you can do it.

Other people say that be idle is good and is right. There are many persons like inventors or scientist that they have great ideas when they are sleeping or when they are lying in the bed, but when that brilliant idea comes to they mind, they dont stay right there imagine that idea. They get up and they start working in that idea that they have and they work day and night until they complete and they make it real.

"Imagination is important than knowledge!

Imagination is more important than knowledge because you don't actually have to know something, you can use your imagination instead.

You can use your imagination to solve math problems. You can use your imagination to build stuff. You can use your imagination to draw or design.

You can use your imagination to solve math problems. When you don't know or don't understand something, sometimes you can use your imagination. You don't actually have to know anything to solve the math problem, but sometimes is best to use your imagination because you don't know what the problem is going to be about. For example, if you don't know how to do math or you never got to go to school, you can use your imagination to solve the math problem.

You can use your imagination to build stuff. If you like to build or to make stuff, you can always use your imagination. It's best to use your imagination when your building things because if you use your imagination, you can create things that nobody did before. Some of the useful things that you're building can help a lot of people. For example, you can build toys, make video games, or do anything you want to build with your imagination.

You can use your imagination to draw or design. You can do a lot of great thing with your imagination and not just have to know everything. You can do different things or different designs with your imagination. Some people use their imagination to draw things or make things. For example, you can draw pictures, make cloths, or design things that you like using your imagination.

You can do many different thing like designing, building, or even making things just by using your imagination and not just your knowledge. Like Scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

That means that you don't actually have to know everything, some people can use their imagination to change the world and make a lot of things. You can do anything using your imagination!",human
"Do you think being in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is a good thing? I think it can be bad.

When you are trying to accomplish things and make friends, it can get you hated. First off when you open up to people and be honest with them, they aren't going to like it and turn on you and hate you. when they see you succeeding and doing better than they are, they will talk about you because they arent where you are and they will make you try to feel down and unsuccessful.

When trying to do good things in life people will down really low to the point where you give up, and just try to fit in and do bad thing that could lead you down a wrong path, to where you can end up in prison or dead you can end up in the wrong crowd, when you thought they were good people. They will manipulate you at first thinking they are good people and want to see you accomplish being thing in life. Once you get to know them and see who they really are you will see the complete opposite and it could be too late to turn back.

"I am not agree because everybody in this world can be freedom to think or to do whetever they wan because we have the independence of right. They can enthusiasm for things or wons that they did.

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems.

Thats why practicing is important.

Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,

learn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.

The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around.

"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.

It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes

.Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.

Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .

Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .

Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",human
"Be a master in any area is something really awesome, because you already have experience and you already know what are you doing. There is positive and negative things for being a master.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

You can stay in the position that you are right now but you can always grow and be better everyday.",human

"Should students have partnerships with companies that interest the type of employment they want? Students think it's a great idea to go to different businesses because it will be helpful to them in the future. If a student is stuck on what he wants to do in life the businesses can help them see what they want for their future. Students should have partnerships because students can get more skills about that job, students learn more about the job their going for, and student can see if that the job they really want to be in.

First, students can get more skills about there job because they are in the business hands they can go around learning on how they do everything. They also get to see how the company is ran and how they handle business. Student can learn a lot we it comes to the business if the company shows them about it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Their going to want to go to the Tech center about it their going to want to learn more.

Second, is that they learn more about the business by going to the company. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company. They will learn about the paper work over there. They will even know where they want to work at over there if they learn more about it. They will have a fun experience about their job they most likely want to do when they get older. They would be even more interested to take classes at school about business and will pursue in that type of employment .

Third, students can really see if they want to be in that type of business. Similar to the other two this helps them, but not only if they want to pursue in that job it's for if they really don't want the job. Also they can find a back up plan if that business is not the right one for them. They can go see if its a bad business, if it helps with the future, and if it's the job they want to go after. They can't focus them to like if they didn't see it for themselves they won't do it if it's not for them, they're going to find something that they want to do not what they need to do. Students can see of they want to work there they can see the positive and the negative of the business they can't be focused, or they can't just cant be focused on that one thing.

In conclusion, The students get to choose if they want to or not. They should know what they want to or figure out what they would do in the future. Students can't be focused to do mainly anything they have to find what they like for they can do it. Other people may say that they will go there and not learn anything,however if students go there for what they are a looking for they can pursue it. If students font get to choose then students wouldn't get more skill about the job, wouldn't learn as much about the job, and wouldnt't even want to see the type of job. Students can see they future if they get the help they need by companies letting them learn about it will help students pursue their occupation.",human
"Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. We the people shouldn't be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn't as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you won't stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that's how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who don't motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I'm writing.

An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don't accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like ""Yes! I did it!""and that way they won't have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.

In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.

For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don't study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President.

There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can't depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?.

"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people.

My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then you're powerful already. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. People can't ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Hate on you, but don't let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then you're doing something great, if they're not hating on you, then you're not doing anything really.

My second reason is that you're a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by it's neck, and just yank it, cause it's yours. You gotta take over your life now. Don't wish, and wait. Start now, and don't let stuff handed to you. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you don't feel like it. You will be great, and you'll thank yourself in the future.

My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people. Ah, yes nobody likes a person that's just ""normal"". I find that quite lame, and boring. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. For example: You wouldn't want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. You are more active, than just sitting down. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful.

My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique than most people.",human
"In my opinion i think a homework club would be great, most students want to fix the grades and get better ones mostly with subjects they struggle with usually math or sci ens but with extra help the student will be able to understand better which helps raise there grade.

Teachers are usually very open when it comes to help but most students are afraid to ask, with this club it will be easier to ask for help from the teachers.

I dont see a lot of cons with this idea but i tried my best find some, some students are fairly slow learners and it usually takes up time to teach them, its also hard for the student to be engaged in what there learning. most students have after school activities other than the homework club. Like sports and might arrive late to there activities.

There might not be enough people to help, though i doubt that there wont be enough people to help it may be possible but in a different way after school or work people are usually tired and dont have enough energy to stay engaged in learning or teaching.

Back to pros ya know the good stuff, mental health almost every student goes through a faze where the stress levels are high but most of that stress comes from is school work, with the club teachers will be able to helps students with home work, students will be used to asking for help.

I think this club is a good idea it will defiantly help students learn better while there struggling.",human

"Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.",human
"Dear principal, ''This is what i think about community service.""

I think community service is helpful because you can help the community. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. Community service is helpful because you can help people in the hospital and you can clean the streets. By helping people in the hospital, you can help people that are sick and in the streets you can help clean up from the parks and the street floor. Also i think that the principal should decide the people that should do community service. One way that the principal should decide is by choosing the people that got a 75% or higher on their report card.",human

School is the place where we get opportunity to learn different things. Schools makes you capable to choose your own way. The main reason to go school is to make our career. Career is directly related to the employment. Everyone wants to do the best in their life. Employment is the thing that helps you to do best in your life and also helps us to understand who we are and how important we are. Now a days, school have partnerships with companies to help students to choose their interests employment. So, if you select me to visit and learn about the works, it will helps me to understand about the interest that I have for my future.

The most important things in students life is to choose their own interest, to make their future happy and peaceful ,but they really don't understand where will they go because of the pressure in their mind. So, I want to be selected to visit and learn about the work. It helps me to understand about the characteristic of the different works, and also helps me to recognize my interest for my career. Employment is not the biggest thing,but the interest is the biggest things. If we have interest in something, we defiantly work hard to get that goal. For example: I had a one friend whose name is Generic_Name, she choose to be a doctor in first, but then she realize that she never had any interest in doctor. After that, she left her job and become a photographer because photographic is her real interest not to be a doctor. That's why, I don't want to be confuse in my life. I want to be clear about my future.

All the people in this world are different, they have different aim in their life. Some wants to be doctor,some wants to be an engineer,pilot,photographer,dancer,etc. In this 21st century,all the parents wants their children to be a doctor or an engineer or in the other biggest post but not all the children have same interest as their parents have. Although they have different aim or interest, they join in the work that their parents wants because they don't understand the value of their interest. So, if the school or any companies allow students to explore or visit about the works, they better understand the value of their interests and never join in any other works that they don't want to be. I have an example of my own sister: In first, she joined in the medical line because my parents wants her to be a doctor and after she read some of the courses of the medicine,she realize that her interest is not to become a doctor and then she left her courses and start another courses. So, I really don't want that same things happened to me.

Time is very important for everyone. Nobody wants to waste their time because they believe that time is money. So,why students waste their time to choose the way that they don't want to go. Everyone has rights to select their own jobs. The problem is not that they don't get opportunity to choose their jobs,the problem is that they don't understand where is their destination. For example: If you left your dog in a street that he never walked,

then how can you expect that he accomplished his destination? Same happened to the students life, if someone who is well-experienced didn't tell them about the journey of life or how to choose their interest,how can we except that they will become a successful person.

Lastly, I want to say that if you select me to visit and learn about the work ,then I get opportunity to learn about my interest which helps me to get a better future. And also, if you select me I will aware other people about the interest or works and also help them to choose their interest. If I understand my journey, then I expect that I will success to get my destination. So, I humbly request you that please select me to visit and learn about the work that I have interest to do.

"My uncle has in his wallet 100 dollars, he give to me 10 and stay with the rest,I tell him to save the money for tomorrow he well need it, but he spend all the money to buy shirt pants and hats, and the next day he was asking for money for the gas for the car. My unclewas happy for the money and to buy things with the money and fro not listen we was need it for tomorrow. He spend all the money in things that are good for him but he knowing he will need it, for tomorrow he spended it, are all.

Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choise. Once of my friend was having money on his paket he says,""lets go whatch a movie on the cinema"". but all the rest of my friend we tell him to ""NO"", Because the movie was aready in CD and was much less money than go whatch it in the cinema. When my friend recibe ours opinions we see the situation in other perspective of the he was thinking. Even my friend want to whatch the movie on the cinema, should be a to spend a lot of money to pay. and that how we tell him to buy it.

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. My Dad give to be money to buy anything that i want, knowing that tomorrow I will need a white shirt, I buy a game and my dad tell me about the place that we need to go and will need the shirt and for my obsession for the game the nezt day was asking if they can give me money to buy the shirt, and my dad tell me yesterday,""I tell you to buy it, but you don't listen to me"". Even I was knowing about the shirt, this happen because i did't listen, In adition, all the talk and learning, and that day after the money I save it for this type of case.

The case that happen in resume, all talk about how important is that to listen to the people around you, All this situation happens because there were listen to the person next to it.

and you, In sometimes is okay to that more than one person talk to you?",human
"First impressions is what I learn from many people. People have many impressions and yes it is hard to change.

Impressions are special to some people but it also could effect people in certain ways. Ways where your whole behavior might change or attitude or maybe your whole person. When we first meet people we see their first impressions and we see on how they are or we check on how their behavior is. We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them.

Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think it's impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

Some people don't understand that some people can't change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same. Impressions are something you can't change from people.",human
"Would you like to seek multiple opinion from different people? I think is good for you to seek opinion from people . Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends,

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.

"Dear principal

I think that you should require students to perform community service.

It will help all elementary school students to do better on their school work. you can let students that are interested in this program to participate in it.

Students that do not want to participate, must let them do what they want.

Principal I will be part of this program and i will help those elementary school students.

you still have to ask the students that are interested if this program will affect their grades in school.

I will help you organize this program.

I will also bring as many tutors as possible.

I will try to make this program successful.

Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program.

This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them.

I will do my best to make those students successful.

You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate.

We need as much students as possible.

Helping people is one of my hobbies.

We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time.

We can provide sports and other things that they want.

We can make it as an after school program.

"Yes, I'm agree. I'm agree because the success consists of keep trying without never loss the enthusiasm. You need to keep trying until you get what you want because that's the goal.

I will give you, and tell you what a pass through like a example. When I came to the United States; It was a may 21, 2014 (I thinks that's the correct day, I'm not sure). I was 13 years old, almost 5 years ago. I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, ""I'm never giving up, until i get it"". That was my goal. I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it.

Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET IT, and NEVER GIVE UP! That's it. :)",human
"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

So please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either.    ",human
"In my opinion.

I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do eny things, but not every one wants to work hard to do.

Example.

In my personan I think to have my own helicopter in the future.

In this word evething goods is posible something more than more beyonnd whtaever my effort my or how many i give to soporting them. Even in my life or my phat way so many dificult, but I velieved in my faiht there is nothing impossible.

But i have to work hard to get them ,because nothing come easy ,everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose nothing to try ,try and try becouse wiil be successful In the future.

Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered.

The people never grow because they fear to try, to do some bighest or highest is the most enemig byself .I can't grow more toll,but I tread believed in my self and first God, will be grow me in wisdom that is my best part I can't do by mayself,the first thing to is to have good health, and my family to.

So I agree to do something beyon what I already Mastered.",human
"One topic "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". when the person want to progress with something the person maybe failure or maybe not, if you work hart and you focuss on your goals because everybody try to do some better on his life.

I'm agree with churchill' because the statement is important role not always your won when the people has a goals , each time when we try something new, we will able to success the first time but the problens is to how your work for you not failure on your life. when you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you cant not failure.

Second ereason, the british prime ministern say that because maybe he do something and he try to do with different ways. The

British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to mejories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life. When you get a success, your was enthusiasm.

Last reason, I see if you want to be successful on your high school or in your job you only need is beleive in your self.

Because you was enfocus at 100% when you wannt or need something tat was be more easy for you beacuse you work really hart for take a success because when you have success you was a enthusiasm and them you try to work more and them in your future was more success.

conclusion. to the british say that is really important because not all of person want to work hart for won and them take success. On my case when i start study on Generic_School , I failure to many time on my class because on the time i dont like do nothing but when i failure the last time on my sol . I say and thing own my self , to i want success on my class . My goal and dreams is pass my sol and graduated from Generic_School.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opinion for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's it's good decision, because they will have more infermations and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taking at school.

I think students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home.                                             ",human
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I know that us student are responsible for our grades in school but a B average just to play sports or be i some sort of activity is pretty dumb most students have C averages if you change this policy you will have lots of mad parents or students i think you don't want to be the bad guy here. I think and i think i speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an F that way you passing you class or classes but you also know that its not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.",human
"Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" In Jefferson's eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration.

In the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment.

Some argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. Furthermore, if one's life is spent constantly working, one's brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health.

Finally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. If one's brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today.

Cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,",human
"Yes, i am agree with Emerson`s statement about show your own individuality.

I believe that each person has 2 face`s 1 is used in the work or in the school,and the other face is showing on specific moments in your life as stress or your soccer team is losing 5-2.

one example of that is: when you are so angry an involuntary you use bad word, and after that you feel very well with yourself. Although what you make,but some part of you is broken for what you did;That simple think make you more human as anyone in this world, because is innecesary try to be perfect when you are not ready to be perfect in this accomplishment and wonderfull world.

He make friends but those were more adult`s for them but that neve was something important to him that really change now, nevertheless every friend that he make left the school, the acctitude of him change now;he make sure to pass 2 SOL in the 11 grade but also something in their hearth was gone.

"Students chould not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate. Electives are just extra classes needed to graduate and they also have no pont if the student are not actually interested. po p",human
"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators.

One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies.

Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching.

Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",human
"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didn't do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home.

Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You can't control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. That's why you can't predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isn't good.

Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didn't understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you can't do it because you're at home and nobody can explain the material you don't understand.

Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. You're free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time.

You be able to kill two birds on the same shot.

To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. That's why i would never change them for one computer at home.  ",human
"Here's a fact why you should go to the museum, going to a museum helps you pay attention more. A museum is an enjoyable, education activity here's why I think it is, you can be with your friends,learn new things school hasn't taught you yet,you get to move around.

First of all, you can hang out with your friends, so both of you can learn together, understand, spend together so you both can know each other better. Usually when you hang out with someone when it's not during school you can build your friendship stronger, trust each other better. You feel a lot comfortable around people when you both learn together. Bonding together with someone is really important helps you communicate to your friends, when you forget what happen the next day you could ask your friend.

Secondly, you can learn new things school hasn't taught you yet, or understand things school taught you, but you forgot half of the things. You can review it again, you can also be ready when school teaches you that lesson or subject and you would already know what happen. Study shows if you go to a museum you will likely pass that class you're struggling with. When you go to a museum, improve you listening skills and pay attention better, later on you can pass your tests and SOLS.

Finally, you get to move around when you're in school your brain gets tired so it focuses on other things when it should be paying attention,your brain pays attention when you're moving. When you're sitting down you usually think about sleeping soon, and you forget things fast when you don't pay attention and get a bad grade in that class. Or forget what to turn in,or even forget to write important things down like notes, tips, what you're gonna do tomorrow in school. Moving around calms your brain down and your body too, you wouldn't feel rushed, or you wouldn't feel sleepy at all.

In conclusion, this is why you should go to a museum, you can be with your friends, learn about new stuff you didn't know about, and move around. ",human
"The reason why the school board shouldn't add hours to school because students already go to school to much and they would like more time off of school so they can do their homework, hangout with their friends, play sports out of school, and get more time to do their chores around the house.

The school board shouldn't add more hours because if students have appointments then they will have to put a later time but if the place of their appointment closes a little early then the students will have to leave school and that will make them have missing work, late work, more work to do at home with little amount of time, and more stress for the students to finish the work on time.

If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they dont belive their worker they could get fired and then the student won't have a job, they won't get paid, and they won't have money to pay for what they need.

This is why the school board shouldn't add hours to school. ",human

"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",human
"I agree with these statement because the students need to finish the school for graduate.

Many parents support they's sons.

After you finish the school need to looking for a job.

For example i divided my time for study and working after school.

It's a hard work but is necessarily for a better life.

The people need to divide the time for doing many things.

Many people do not done the school for different reasons for example, disscution with the parents a bad relationship parents with the sons.

Sometimes the students do not pay attention in class because in home they have a lot of problems.

The students can't concentrate because the problems between the parents affect they's life.

My life is come be hard because i do not have my parents by my size is sadness know they's far away of me.

Keep you brain busy thinking good idea is better that stay on home doing anything.

When i was begin to study i was so scared because i had not idea about a word in English.

"The meaning of this is to save all the energy that we can. In all the schools spend a lot of energy using; cell phones, internet or using the computers doing test, works or homeworks. It is probable that students and teachers are not agree to extending the school day two hours.

First, the schools don't need the follow that model and also to extending the school day two hours. If all the schools are agree about to extending two hours more, then they are braking the rule to converse more energy and resources. It is a lot of things that schools can use and the principal thing that school are using is energy. In the school office all the teachears are working all the time making copies, works and they are doing a lot of files.

Second, it's not necessary to extending two hours more in the schools, students can do campaigns to how reduce the energy or making groups of people and try to do things that help to conserve more energy. In this case we can created proyects that help better to try to not spend a lot of energy in fact to try to conserved. And then conserve some of energy.

Third, some of the students can created devises for extract the solar energy and used. Teachers can help to support to the students creating more ideas or proyects. Maybe is not going to change as how much energy we are using, but it is some that helps to reduce the energy, the point is to try to conserve the energy that we are using.

At this point to conserve energy and resources schools can follow that model, extending tha school day two hours. They have a lot of time to make more proyects maybe better ideas to how conserve the energy.

In all the cases the people, students, and teachers are not agree to extending the school day two hours. Beacuse it is something that we can stop it, making proyects to conserve de energy and resources. To sharing the campaings to anothers students.        ",human
"Dear: Generic_Name

I Understand that you are concidering the idea to work in group. I appreciate what are you trying to do and I agree with, for two reasons I think working in group can give you a lot of benefits because you can help each other, so you can do a better job and, also you can share differents ideas with your parners.

The first reason is that you can do a better job working in group. For example when I am working in group in my job I ask my parners to check my work to make sure I am doing a good job.

additianally, you can share different ideas with your parners or also, you can share your toys that you usually use for work. For example when I am working in group with my class I always ask my friends if I can use their stuf.

Therefore I strongly believe that working in group give you a lot of benefits. which I allow with positive for two reasons. you can do a better job helping each other and, also you can share your ideas with your parners. thank for your time.

"It working in a group more better or we get beneficial them working alone?

working in group have many beneficial them working alone. In my opinion working in group is better them working alone. Because friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we all can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And we don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing alone.

Friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. And we all put our interest to do the best as we can with the work. And we try that the work look good and nice. Also we put our effort to do the work and that the teacher see that we all work together. And we try our best to do the work the way that she or he wanted to be. And friends or partners can be good if we need to do a drawing or with the hand writing. Also if you're partners help you with the work the teacher is going to sacrifice with the work that all of you are doing.

We all do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Because we try that everyone have one part of the work. And that way we can finish the work fast. Also everyone participate in the work. And we all have some part of the credit. Also we try to do the work fast but also we try that the work look good. And we no just do the work fast because we want to finish quick and them do nothing. Sometime it because the teacher a specific time to finish and with a group we can finish on time and also the work can look good too.

We don't feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing the work alone. We don't feel the work hard because we separate the work in parts. And if there is 4 in a group we all 4 do a list one part of the work. Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work.

In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation. Because you have to intelligent and organize first and everyone know what they have to do we all can get a good grade in the work. Some of the benefits that we can get working in groups are. Work with friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And final we don't feel the job or work hard s we usually felt doing alone. Also working in groups it help to the development. For me it better working in a group have many beneficial and is very helpful to do the work good and nice foe the teacher can be proud of the group work. And also is mire fun to be in a group with your fiends and all of you get a good grade. ",human
"I think students can benefit if they are able to attend classes from home, even know the distance but learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life.                                                                                                          ",human
"Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. The employers look for people's responsible, and make a good job. Most time the employee do not have experience, and many time the employers look those. Many people look for a job without have experience for a better life, and learning new stuff. In lots places taking decision for giving job for people's do not have experience.

First, most of people do not have to study by cause not working, by do not have experience, and do not can pay the study. The employers can giving news opportunities of working for people's have a better life, and future. Anyhow, the employee doing a hard-working, and the employers be glad. When the employee doing a hard-working is for news opportunities.

Second, nevertheless when you are responsible may-be your employers giving a raise. To be a good employee help always for letter of recommend about your ability. Also more people have the requisite by working; although needing experience but can learned. A job can teach the people's a lot things. For example, responsibility, respect, and more manners. The manners is very important in your potential, and your characteristics is important too, because the employers evaluate this.

"The more the better ! Getting Advice from many people is something that every person has do at least once. Getting advice from many people can help you get a different perspective, it can help you in the future,and it can help the community.

Having a different perspective is really good . When you have a different perspective of something you might have a better adtuided . Let's say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. Having a different perspective can not only give the situation a better perspective but it can also give you a different perspective. Hear me out not only can other peoples perspective give the situation a different point of view but yourself as well. I believe that having advice from many people can really help you have a better perspective, adtuided,and understanding.

Advice from more then one person can help your future. As you grow up you will release that you start to ask for more and more advice. I think the more you ask for advice the more you are most likely to be successful in your future. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. For example my teacher once told me that not understanding how to do something is okay because from that is how we learn from it. The advice given to you is something you will pass down . I think that it's amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice can help you in the future by developing more and more,remembering it though your life,and pass it on to other generations.

Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice. When advice is spread form person to person it spreads form community to community and then it spreads from state tot state and eventually the world. Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well

Asking for opinions from more then one person can help you see different opinions,help you later in life, and help the world. Advice can help to see different points of view, help you in your ,and help our community become better. In conclusion I believe that getting advice can help having different perspective and help the community.                 ",human
"Is it a good idea for a young students to commit to a career in high school? It's a great idea so students can work on there career, and not need to focus on what they don't need in high school, to work towards their career. Reasons I agree are, they may want to follow their parents choice in career, can use school courses to excel in career choice, and why it's a good idea to start a young age.

They can follow their parents choice in career. That can be a easy choice for many people, because the student can ask for advice from their parents. They can ask their parents what courses' they took as a young student as they once were. The reader may be asking ""what if their parents' didn't go to high school?"" that can be true and what if the career the parents' have isn't for the student to follow. Then they don't have to follow their parent career, and they can choice their own career, or any close family members, or anyone they look up to, and would like to be as close as possible as them when their older. You can always just follow your own career and can start a generation for your family to follow your example.

If the parent choice didn't work they can choose what classes they can take to help them reach the career the student wants. Schools are all different so not all of them will have the same courses. Example if you want to be a chef and some sort of cook, you can take a cooking courses for the year. The teacher can show you how to prepare a dish and how to present. There are so many choices in career's you can pick from. If you want to be a engineer you have to take your four main classes Math,Science,History,English. These classes will help you in the long run through high school years. The more experience you get from this courses will give you in vantage to the other student that choice your career later in their high school years.

Finally the last reason, why it's a good idea to start early. It's pretty simple that you don't have to worry about what your career is going to be. It can be a lot easier if you know what you want to be, you can already plan the courses you would like to take. When people ask you ""what are you going to do when your done with school?"" you would say ""it's none of your business will see in the years to come!"". You shouldn't say that it's just rude to say. When someone does say that you would have a answer and you should say it proudly. You would just focus on what you need to do. Don't let anyone distract you on what you want to do.

Conclusion on why it's a good ideal for students' to have a career choice in their younger age. Following parents or close family member to the career they choice. If their career choice isn't for you, make a career you can follow and want to follow. Taking courses in school that can help you excel in career that you picked for yourself. When asked that question on what your going to be, you'll be ready answer it.",human
"Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are.

One, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. However, the person need to be interest on the topic you're talking about or just be goofy. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know you're alone. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldn't go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window. She smile back to him and then she went to bed.

Two, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when you're trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. If your in pain or suffering don't take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. People don't realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish.

Three,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person don't care about your feelings or the friendship. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on.

In conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they don't even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh that's everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them.",human
"Some schools have a program that older student and the young ones that could help one another. For example, the young students could get some advice from the older ones because they ready took the program or the Sol before so can help them understand what their are trying to do. Another example, would be that the older ones can learn new things from the young student to see what is different from the past and preisant. Last example, that the older student and the young student can help each other out to come up with an ideas so other student can help out to try and make the a bigger program. Some school do not have program but they should so others student can get to now each other and even have ideas that can help others.

Secondly, student form lower grade to higher grade level should be a in the program to learn stuff new.

Another example,the older student be in the program to help a younger to try and make something easy to him.",human
"Students should not be alowd to graduate with the three year program because the student my have a job, focus on there academics, be involved in a extra curricular activities after scholl. Students may have or need a job for many such ass, being able to sport there family so they are not always going to be available after school to attend those classes required to graduate in 3 years. Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4 year university or even attending a community college. students also need some time of work expires so they need that job so they are able to put on there resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires. Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more chalaging, and give out more homework then regular classes. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that.

My conclusion is that no students should not be alowd to graduate early using the 3 year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in there lives so i believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years.

"do you agree or disagree with the statement?

in my personal opinion i do agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. its impossible to change because thats the very first time you meet someone new in your life. first impressions are very important. there is no way you can change first impressions its not like we can go back in time to switch our answer. making a bad first impression can go very wrong but thats that its done and you cant go back. for example like making a first impression at a job interview like obviously making a good impression is very important if you want a job.

i can also understand why some may say ""almost impossible"" because technechly you kinda can. for example if both of you say ""can we start over"" or something like that. your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. so really it goes both ways how someone may take it. i personal dont agree with that because it dosent sound right or feel right. some may move on and ectually forget. while others may not and mentally remmber.

inconclusion it is all based on the reader and how they take it. like i have mention i personal dont think you can change your first impression. we cant go in time and change the past. it donesnt sound reasonablie theres no real reason. some may agree with what i say some may not. then again i can kinda see how someone may want or how to change there first impression.

"Have you ever felt that the weekend isn't enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasn't enough. I bet that you did it, and I'm going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week.

Although some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends.

Those who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. They think that weekends aren't enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time.

One reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldn't pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. As example of this is myself. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldn't be able to keep my grades high and I wouldn't pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed.

Another reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. So, he pays rent, his cell-phone payment and food. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldn't be able to have a job after school. Therefore my school should not change

its schedule of having five days of school.

Based on the reason that I gave, it's clearly to see that having four-day school week offers good benefits that the regular standard weed of five-day does not give, but I strongly believe that the five-day school week is way better then the four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a new kind of schedule that some business are implementing called four-day work week that consists of extending the school day two hours. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. ",human
"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.

For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something you'd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, there's always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.

Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it.

In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.             ",human
"I donr undertan why people is stupid to ''act' as someone else. From my point of view, is so stupid. Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, that's no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention. Personally, I feel comfortable with the little what I have. It's not my idea be someone that I don't. And I also start to be neutral. How is it? For me, it's like if someone want to be friend, good; if people do not want to meet me, it's ok, too. Lastly, I don't care about other people, I only care about me, my 4 friends and my family, and that's it. I feel I don't need to meet more people. I'm good with what I have, because while less people I met, less people treason me. ",human
"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldn't commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they don't want to do anything.

A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasn't something that she wanted because she didn't like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind.

Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I can't commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I can't commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it.

There are many students at my age that really don't want to do anything with their life or they don't have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably it's something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive.

Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldn't only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

"Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do.

Succeeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words aren't even similar. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. For example, anger doesn't let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. When trying to find a new job at any place but you don't know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. Because you won't have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. They won't choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job.

However other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. For example, achieving something is no that easy. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. Studying it's not just passing classes but it's about learning things for the next day. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that it's not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. But what if the SOL is failed twice won't that prejudice your next year. Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that it's over. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. That's happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. Let's pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because it's over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and it's there to fight until it's achieve it. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. Learning a new job it's so frustrate because at the beginning you won't have any idea on what you are doing. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you don't depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear.

As previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away. My solution is to have confident in yourself. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day. Thank you!!",human
"""Failure is not the worst thing, not to try is worst thing in the world."" To become successful, people must try. They should not give up. If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation. Because failure is an important role that plays in the pursuit of success.",human
"Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be in a school play? I have, one enjoyable activity I would want to be is a school play. I think this will be an enjoyable activity for school because you can meet new people, work with a team, and most of all have a great time.

During the play the cast members can make new friends and meet new people. It's important that the cast gets to know each other and become friends. Also they can rehears lines together. It's also helpful to make new friends especially if you shy. It's important not to be shy on the night of the actually play. You have to be brave and have confidence in yourself for the night of the play.

Another example why this this would be an enjoyable activity for school is working together as a team. Working together as a team can be enjoyable and important. For example the cast can help build sets, make costumes, rehears lines, and so much more. Sometimes after rehearsals the cast can go out to eat or have fun. also working together as a team is easier so you can get more work done.

The last reason why having a play is enjoyable because after all the hard work with the team everyone can watch the play. You will be able to perform the play in front of students,teachers,friends,and families. The most important thing is that you had a fun time making, being in the play, and working with other students.

Being in a play is and enjoyable activity because you can meet new people, work as a team,and have fun. Those were a couple of reasons and examples on why having a school play is an enjoyable school and educational activity.        ",human
"introduction

The people who value selft-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities,

instead of taking their own decision about life's important matters. When we say experts we are talking about people that know alot more about the topic then us. We can compare this an a teacher and student.

The teachers they have graduated from what they know lets say science class. They have to do alot to become a teacher in that career. This is why I say that if we value self-reliance we need help from experts. that way we can subcess in life. However there is some decision that we can take by ourself. For example, we can choose if we want to drink alcohol, and smoke. for that type of decision we just have to think about who we are hurting too, and as we know it is ourself and nobody else. if we don't take about ourself and the decision thaty we make nobody will.

Reason 1

In my opinion self-reliance is really important in every single person life. When we talk about Self-reliance is about decision. There is times that we think we are right in every decision that we make. However, we have to know that no one is perfect as a human. So, there is times where we make bad choices. One good example could be when we are tenergers. at that age is when we need more help than anything because there is alot of things that can influenciate us really easy. At that time is when we need help from experts and what better experts then our parents. They want the best for us, so they will teach us what could be the best and what have to really matter is this life because they love us. I'm not talking and general because there are some parents that don't really care about what his son or her dauther are doing, but some of them do. Also, we can look for another type of experts who can be profesional and have a diploma in what they are experts in. So, it can be really helpful for us to subceed because they have been studying for years their career. Also, it can help us to make better decison trought life and make us a better person.

Reason 2

Bad decison can hurt ourself. decison is something that we all have to make one day. it could be good or bad decision or sometimes there are some decision that look good, but it could take us to do something bad. However ther are decison that cna hurt ourself and can take us to do something stupid in life. For example, a person want to nibest money to create a restaurant. At first it sound good because what we all think is that we only win in this type of business, but the reallity is that it could be like a challange for the person. some people don't take sometime to think about the consecuences of creating a restaurant. They don't think about the things that they have to pay out from the money that they are making of the restaurant. They don't think about that they can lose all their money if the restaurant doesn't work. When it happens that people lose all their money they can get depress, and some of them have even take their life. So, here is when we need the help from experts and not take the decison of creating the restaurant by ourself. Those people that we call experts know alot more then us because they have graduated from it. They know everyhting about business and what could be best for us. So, we can subcess in business life and don't lose money.

counterclima.

Someone would argue that making decison by ourself is better because that way we won't have to blame on anybody if we make bad decision. Also, we can learn how to be responsable in the decison that we make. Howevere, we don't need to wait untill that happen better look for experts, so they can help us to make good decision and not bad decision two heads are better ten one.

conclusion

In conclution the help from experts is the best way to do the things. They can teach us how to be better and thats why they have been created in this world to look for them and ask for help. sometimes we need to acept that we can do it by ourself and thet we need help from experts or our patrents. We have to look for different sources to subcess in life. In some points we have to be strong but to take any decision we need to be social, what I mean by it is to ask for help and make good decision.",human

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn.

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online.

Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up. Talking to the young kids can help them learn about the kid and how they act in class and around other people.

It can also help younger students in many ways.

"Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. ",human
"Control

What you do in your life is your choice, you could choose to become a doctor, a teacher or an artist. Having a good mindset and working hard shows good character. ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" said John Lubbock, therefore you control what you do, who you hang out with but sometimes the environment around will say otherwise

Everyone has a voice one way or the other and is able to control what they do. Scientist have done test and have seen that 50% of teens smoke because their friends smoke so they can fit in. Teens are able to say no but they choose they wrong road. If you choose to hang out with people that aren't good for your health and mindset then they aren't people to stick around with. Looking after yourself is better than winding up somewhere you shouldn't be with the people you shouldn't be with. It has been proven that mom's all around the world are able to point out whose a true friend that cares for you and who isn't.

You have control on what do you or even think. Teen at Generic_School choose to skip class all the time , knowing they'll end up in trouble says Generic_Name in her article. Teens knowing this still choose to skip. They lose that control of thinking for themselves. Every time a teen even thinks about skipping it's bad character. Being mature and well behaved at school is good character. Every teen has control of what they do at school.

Others may say that the environment around you is what you show in yourself. According to Generic_Name article teens living in bad conditions can create bad characters when they grow up. Teens living in places that are broken down that aren't healthy living condition often end up in gangs and dropping out of school. Either then teens living in good home conditions they end up going to collage and having a good life. Teens everywhere can decade on what they do with their lives no matter where you live you can overcome it and be someone great in life.

"I belive the elimination of human contact due to technology is a positive thing. Now days everything you need is only a click of a button away. this makes life easier and better. techonolgy is evolving such as humans are evolving too. on the other hand, technology can alsow be used as a bad thing. it could be used as a source of bullying. Technology has given us the privilage to be able to play a game with many people even though we are all far away. When tchnology was not as developed, you had to write a letter, mail it , and wait weeks for a response. Now days thanks to technology you can talk to someone on the other side of the world and not have that time gap to wait for there response. Technology has also made the world a safer place. we now have all types of camers for different things. before technology it was almost impossible to stop someone from breaking into your home or catching someone stealing. however, today we have camers protecting our homes, stores have cameras to catch shoplifters. Technology plays a big rol in education. Students have better education because of technology. you dont have to go to a library to buy a book to learn something. Today you can look everything up on the internet.

Technology might be a good thing and make life easier but it can alsow be used as a bad thing. Many people use technology for hacking. Hackers can steal credit card information, your personl information, and other personal things. Other people use technology for stalking, or tracking someone.. there are many dar webs on the internet, also known as the 'BLACK MARKET'. On these websites human parts are sold for a big amounnt of money. Technology can also be used for human traficking. and for selling drugs. The end of the day, i belive technology can be a very helpful tool for humans but it all depends on how one uses it. in conclusion, I belive the limination of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effect on people's lives.",human
"First impressions are not ""almost impossible to change"". They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?""

A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others.

When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop

(also don't over think it because this can cause stress and also won't help you use more of your cognitive ability).     ",human
"PROMPT

In my opinion, prompt is a something positive attitude in our life, and I agree with that because we have to learn how to be prompt. Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals.

I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude.

Do something interesting

Search something new

Talk with a trust friend

After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they don't have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting,

a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good,

because can happened something bad.

A positive attitude is the key to success in life because that's something important we have to do, if don't do something good we don't have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive.

Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I can't do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so that's a good idea to try every thing what we can't do.

A prompt is something what can we do fast and done quickly. Prompt can help us to get everything done early but sometimes can happen something bad, so have to always care and think what we going to do first.

In conlcution prompt, I agree with that statement becuase I like to get everything done and get something better.",human
"I really think that can be really stressed for some students, because there is more pressure for them, because they are taking courses on evenings or summer school, when some of them needs to work or they have to do somenthings at home, but that is a good idea to have 3 years of high school because they are doing just 3 years they can go early to college if they want or another place like NOVA, but on my thought I never will choose to have just 3 years because I feel that can be really stressed for me but I know if want to gradute early nothing is impossible, but if you want to choose just 3 years you have to be positive and had discipline, but there are some students that want to choose this kind of programs and they want to but they are not ready fot this kind of pressure, there is no reason for them to feel bad because there is more chances on the future, they do not have feel pressure because they fail everything happens for a reason.

And my position on this issue is not to choose this kind of programs.",human
"At some point in every ones life,There is a time to be self reliant.

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",human
I agree some times the truth hurts but I mean the were being honesty with you. Some time u dont have to be honest with them but it's some times good tell them what they doing wrong. If u be honest with one and each other they would be honest with you and you guys will have better friendship with each other. it's good to be honest with your parents because if your in trouble they can help you solve the help if something is happening in school. If your not honest with people they won't trust you ever again they will think that you are a person that lies. I you think about it if you did something bad and don't be honest you will get cought for what you did and it would go how you want it to so it batter if you be honest and truthful but things because if your not it wont go your way. But sometimes being honest with people hurts and some people don't want to hurt them but you just have to because if you don't they will get there hopes up and when your honest with them there going to say thank you and that's when they are going to think to them self and say this is what i should of done from the bringing and this the people i want in my life. So some time you just got to be honest with them and they want you in there if it's okay because at lest they were being honest with and you just move on in life. Honesty is good sometimes i agree but then disagree at the sometime so base I'm trying to say that honest it's good sometimes and sometimes it's not but I rather have honest people in my life because they are telling me the truth and they didn't tell me the truth later on I would get hurt by them and I hate getting hurt by people so I rather them telling me the truth right there when i'm talking to them then founding out by other people and getting hurt and for them not being honest with you from the bringing and putting your self down after you find out. I just feel that honest it's just a good thing because it peras for the real life when you get older and have a job and a family because then your ready for all of what is going to come to you in life sometimes life is not fair to other people and you just got to be ready for it in life.,human
"Online Learning

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    ",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

First, distance learning students attend classes on time by online. In many states students live far from schools. Sometimes they can't be on time because of highway traffic. Sometimes cause of bad weather you have to drive slow than speed limit. And you can be late for school. If they late in every first classes they might fail that classes. Suppose they use the online conferencing they can be on time in every classes.

Also, attend to school everyday. Even if you sick for a week you still able to attend to school everyday by way of online or video conferencing. If weather is such a bad you can't go out of the house still able to attend classes from home. Although none is home to drop you off to the school. You can attend school by way of online or video conferencing.

Then, By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere. You can join to the class even if you go to your friends house. Also if you plan to go out the state for few days you can attend to classes from there. Students can enjoy also they can study. They're able to work in online.

In conclusion, for online or video conferencing students doesn't need to worry about there attended. Distance learning students attend classes on time by online. Distance learning students also attend to school everyday. By way online you can attend to classes from anywhere.

"This program will help both with the older and younger student because, the older student have more experience then younger student.

The older students knows a lot of things more than younger students because the older student knows how to read, knows how to do math, and knows science and social study. But, sometimes older student might forget about things that they were taught in elementary school.

Also, there's some new ways that the elementary student are taught in a different ways because it would make it easier for the younger student to understand it more, or the younger student is taught something new and they can help the older student understand what this new idea is, and the older student teach new things for them to know and be papered.

When the older student teach the younger students, they want to papered them because when they start a new unit and the younger student heard of what the unit is about, they know and understands them and will get good grades,and the older students wants the younger student to be papered for next year or this year, also the older student wants the younger students to improve their grades and their test grades.

When the school have a program that pairs older student and the younger student, it helps them because they have new ideas and they know a lot of new different subject that the older students don't know about the subject or a equation. Also, they can bond and tell them how it's like being a kid now days, and the older student tells their stories about their childhood and what it was like being a kid in the past.

"Individuality

I am agree to be independent in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because you can feel proud of yourself. Independent means that you have the control of the you doing, also signify not looking to others for one's opinions or for guidance in conduct. I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you.

The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose.

For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it.

Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it.

Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. Sometimes we don't something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want.

In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",human
"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",human
"I thinks is decions of everyone because if you are smart and if you want to graduation in three year just you have to focuse and give your best and you have the decion in your hands if your decion is yes so do it, because another students can`t do it or din`t like, so i think is opecional, for my selfel i think is greet idea just take three year of the high school but i know is not easy becuase take the high school in three year is very complicate becuase you well have to take course duging the summers and may not be able to take elective couses, but you advance is good.

Reasons. (why is good)

becuase is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a greet estudent and with this year early you can go to the college early or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good estudent and thats can help you because you can find a programs that can help you, because if you want to go to the college the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have find a solucion and the solucion is give you best.

"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy.

To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about.

Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed.

Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.

To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. ",human

"What is one type of job you would like to employ and why would you would you employ it ? The one job i would employ would be a soldier. The one type of work I would employ would be a soldier because it has a lot of money and I want to protect people in the country.

First of all the one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because it has a lot of money.

For example, There was a boy named Generic_Name .Generic_Name was in high school and he was in tenth grade .Generic_Name wanted to be a nurse but his parent didn't want him to be a nurse because they knew that nurse didn't have a lot of money. Generic_Name also wanted to become rich so he could help his family. But Generic_Name dreamed so little for himself. Generic_Name hated when his parent told him that he was not going to be a nurse. When he went to school the next day , he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isn't nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , It's just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesn't have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didn't want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didn't have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didn't have any money problems .

In addition

The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because

I want to protect people in the country.

Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didn't have any siblings. Generic_Name

Generic_Name 's father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didn't let her be because in their country girls weren't allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name 's home and told Generic_Name's father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldn't go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Name's father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didn't want her father to die and she also didn't want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her father's house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl she's a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didn't have any one to protect them .Generic_Name din't want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said he's waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didn't saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didn't have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her .

One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didn't have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers.

Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word.

Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use there own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses.

Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at there own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination.

And thats why i agree with Albert Einstein saying ""Imagination is more important than knowledge""",human
"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life.

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things.

You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true.

It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt.

People wont be able to brake you down that easily.

So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life.

When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it.

Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"".

Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action.

Sometimes your words reflect your actions.

This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life.

Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"".

Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"".

Having faith makes you believe in yourself'

When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action.

But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible.

This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other.

So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude.

Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too.

If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad.

The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours.

For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"".

Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try.

So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",human
"More is always done when we do what we need to do, other wise we get lazy and say ""I'll do it tommorow"". We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important. It's good to have a mindset where you like to get stuff done, that shows that youre an honest person, and it can really say alot about a person. When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then we're suppose to. Doing nothing is easier then doing something, but doing nothing has a bigger consequence then doing something. Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. There are Entrepreneurs around the world that didnt wait to do something with themselves. For example, Bill Gates, he is the richest man in the world with billions of dollars to his name,but how did he manage to get all that money? by doing something and not by doing nothing, doing what he needed to do, when it needed to be done, not waiting for tommorowto do the tacks that he needed to do to get where he is today. Bill Gates was always busy doing something to get stuff done for a company, now he's the owner for Microsoft. Doing something will always bring positivity around you, into your life, another example is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs didnt wait to do something for himslef, he dropped out of college, but it didn't stop him from doing what he wanted to after that. He stayed in a small garge, worked day and night to invent a computer, the MacBook, with this computer, he was going to become a famous Entrepreneur. A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. Steve Jobs is a great example of how much great can come by doing some. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting. So we have to get stuff done so we won't have to worry or stress about it later. to conclude my essay, we should always do something the moment we get the task, other wise it will never be done.",human
"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.

First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students

Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.

Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.

To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.   ",human
"Should the first impressions care and show who individuals are? First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.

In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.

However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.

Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.

People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. What would be if all individuals make a bad impression the first time?",human
"I believe that many accomplishments could be done if you put your focus to it. Sometimes it may be finished on its own without anyone doing nothing about it. I have completed quite a few goals in my life because it was all i would put my focus to. With certain things it takes one of another to be with you through it to help you, Because it would depend on what you need to have done. I've helped lots of people get through on what they needed and sometimes its more of what has to be done.

People always need to help themselves because it would make them better in their life in my opinion. Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it.

So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what you're suppose to do. It's great to help yourself in life because you don't know how good it would turn out in the end. There is people that i know that always worked hard for what they wanted in life and got what they needed. Such good things could happen to anyone.

"I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared.

Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress.

There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier aren't intrested. If High-schools don't take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isn't right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives.

Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors won't have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for test's and final exams.

Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future. After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society.

We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students,

We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study.

"In my opinion, students should not use their phones in classrooms. The students will get distracted . Also, students should keep away their phones for safety. Lot of students can't stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more.

First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom.

They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better.

Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesn't have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we don't know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose.

The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they won't be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students don't need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they don't need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

"One place that i really want to go is Generic_City, Italy. i really want to go here mainly because of the stuff i can do their. I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (he's also a car guy) he's another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

This is why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. because of all off these fun stuff i can do their. All of these are reasons why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. I hope one day i can go to Italy and explore their.    ",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning won't give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and you'll be getting more physical help in a classroom.

Many like distance learning because it's more flexible, but because it's really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people don't like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means they're missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they won't care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""it's online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and won't have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done..

Numerous of computer's systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom.

All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course.

"Failure Is Success

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

When you did something and It makes you failure don't think that why did that happened, or why did you do that although, give up that you can't solve It, you should know and everyone else that we all are strong we will not know until failure comes to you that you are much stronger and be powerful with what you have and what come's to you

Nothing Is more Important then success your life, sometimes failures and make you life hard but It can make your life more powerful, that you will trust yourself and, It will make you stronger and you will take more responsibility for your next steps. For example, my father would tells me all the time that when you get older have your on business and you need to be strong If your not strong ""failures"" can heart you so that's why you need to work so hard and be strong as will to reach your goals. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter. How or why, so you should all ways learn your lesson that, why or how did failure In your success life and happiness never let anything come between you, because you will get stronger each time and better.",human

You might agree or disagree and whine about a subject. Having a argument is a way of dealing with people. Arguments aren't always bad. Arguments make you talk and reason with people. It's good for listening to other thoughts.

The important of not being basis. Sometimes people only listen to they're point of view. They are on one sided scale and basis. Not basis is examine both sides. Asks questions like. Why is this idea more important than others? Does have depth? Is the idea understandable and matter? Is true or false? Theses kinds of questions are needed. Finding the better response.

Determining the right course of action. The proper thinking process for doing the action. People use techniques to make good decisions. Not guessing what you want to do.

"Students will struggle to learn the subjects that the school requires them to take such as History, Math, Science, and English.

Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life. How would it affect you, if you don't atten to school?. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.

Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.

Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.

However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"".

"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world.

Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the one's that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them.

People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set.

I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams.

All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",human
"To conserve energy and resources, some bussines have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consist of ten hours. In my opinion, this idia would bring benefits for some students and disavantages too. For example the students who really like the school it would be a great idia, to be doig team-progets or just spend time with friends and teachers. In the other hand some students don't really like to be 8 hours in the school so I just realize that they would not agree with that idea.

A mayor porcent of the students wo don't like school, decide to quit or just apply to an elective shool. Like in my case olmost 1 year ago i decide to start going to an elective school, the reason is that I work a full tme job after school and it was difficult to arrive on time everyday to the basic school. I thing the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idia, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school. I mean a basic school is better for the students who work at the same time they canmake their schedule smaller and have enough time to sleep, work, and to study. In conclusion, this is my point of view.",human
"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we choose our character traits.

For example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. You have to balance it all out. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.

Also, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. and even discover new things. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.

Therefore, my next example is being a over yourself. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say ""there no fun"" or they are ""party poopers."" I'll confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I could've not yelled I could've just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.

Finally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.",human
"The Former British Prime Minister Winston Church Hill once said that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Church Hill because , some people do fail multiple times but they keep doing it until they get it.

British Prime Minister Winston Church Hill was from WWII to help the British to fight with the Germans on war. He help people in his country and America too. Church Hill gave a speech that said

"" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Think that people fail on and on that he mighty think that some people can do it when they need to do. Church Hill the Prime Minister of Great Britain wanted the people to know that your not the only one that fail all the time. Others people are the same like you and your not alone.

He says that we can do it even if we keep trying and trying that it will happen soon for you. That you are responsible to your own work and responsible on your own. Church Hill might? Be the same like us in our life. He might deal with the same problem like us in our life. Even tho he work in the government with other smart people but he can be the same issues.

He want people to know that your not alone you have others to help you in your problems and issues on yourself and others.

but what really the who harm what the please through a machiavellian emotional black mail based of fear of aggresion but under certain circumstances, evil acts can occur without the need of all of us. we have met peolpe who appear to be kind while they gain their trust and that is whea you realize that you are failing that you have been linked to bad people even in recent years,bad people there are people who have an evil background because of their environment can shape us to detect bad peolpe, the occurrence of very mediatic cases of munder or abuse of people make society silvery high because there are such people bad.

The virtues are the qualities we have and that provides a good for the same and for others is to say not knowing how to live whith another in my case, terrible things usually happen to me when I talked to my aunt, I did't know that she was aggressive discriminating well, not only does it happen to me, I have seen more people who go through terrible things that even their own family is bad with onw in case it is terrible to happen with bad people influence.

Which attitude should you make to let your day continuing to be a great day? You get angry and ruin everything, or you give a bright smile and make a nice conversation. Your positive attitude definitely gives you an energy to show your enthusiasm in daily activities. A short fact in Generic_School, students enjoy to go to the library before the class starts, because there is a big welcome from those librarians. They always smile, explain or help you when you need.

Nevertheless, if you are a student having a positive attitude for the future, such as you are willing to study or you want to contribute yourself to community, college or company will value you at a positive way that you are diligence and helpfulness. And then, they may ask you to show more your ability that can make you are more successful.

"i disagree, because of each people in the world still require of help of somebody, if not any peoples can believe that are most that other and with his strengh and ego can to get anythings without help of nobody or only they think follow his intincts and ideas without before they could hear any advise of people that are victorious in the life as in the job for what they always in his mind and heart to know follow advise. In the world still there people very specials that God or the destint to give in our life for help in moments diffilcult that all people in his life occur.

For this, is that i think that each people still need of other people for create a life most easy for his family and us and we can live with calm that take the best decisions in our life and here any reasons for that are very important the advice to take decisions in ours life:

""Still there somebody for you ""

Each people most reliace in his life , always there necessity of any people that can to give advise of as "" what to need to do"" or "" how could you make it "". Always they think that are people fortunates for that , has a person that is still prepared tom give any advise without receive something to change. But for other part the people that are unpleasant , without humility, or intolerant to advise can to fall in decisions very hard that may be can affect your life as the your family, only for not seek help with experts or friends that if has experiences in situations similar to yours decisions. Also we should to be still grateful with people that our help with his advice and why not , we can to help to other people in his life such a avoid a bad consequence in his life.

''Seek rather to perform''

Everybody should to search to peoples that can to help in decisions specifics in the life that can result terrible in ours life, for this is most better hear to person that has a lot experiences in importants matters of the life, later they could to refect that way can to give you the decision . they can think whether is correct or not and create situations for each decisions that take you and that influence would has in your life ,also they shall hear differents point to view for is very certainly of your decisions. Nevertheless , we perfom rather of view or hear differents opinions and actions of people that has experiences good as bad in his decisions. For this, the first step in a situation like this, is seek and seek help of any kind as the friends, professionals, experts, or authorities that know the importance to take a good decision in an important matters in our life.

""Perseverance and Humility""

Always in ours life should to exist the humility, and we believe that everything known and not is necessary seek to experts or receive any advice , but this is a great mistake in the life and for consequence to get failure, disilusionment, or to be alone . Only for follow ours own instincts and ideas without see towards the future and we think that only with our knowledge and intelligence, we believe what we are ""the best"" in this world and that nobody exist , because we have of power, also what happenned not result as we are waiting. after, only for not assets seek experts for that we to give advise of how to confront our decision or how find the best decision without wait a bad result . always has hope that if we hear advice is a little most easy we take the decision.

Always we should to be very carefulness to moment to choose it. Never allow that our mind or think that is it better for us without rather hear advice and reflect about if is or not the correct decisions in this matters.

In conclusion

, all people of the world needs any help to surpass a moment difficult in life, for this , each people should and has that seek and hear different help for take any decisions , if that ours instincts and ideas could not to give still the better answer to a matters,also in each moment we find to a person that can to give any advice that may be has any doubt and we leave to carry for the mind and is most better seek a specialists or friends that has any experience in same decisions.

"There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it. One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea.

Asking for help and guidance. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now he's now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you.

Talking to your priors, family members and communicating. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. That's how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them. People who don't communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what.

Having confidence in yourself. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you won't be nervous to talk in front of a class. One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. this relates to the having confidence because he was scared of talking to people until he starting talking to everybody he saw in the hallways and built his confidence to a new level. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you don't know.

Whats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesn't like it either. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because that's a big deal if you don't, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV.    ",human
"Do you agree or disagree with ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places.

To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I'm mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don't learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.

Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don't understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph.

In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either it's a dream, a location or read and write things. It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness.

In conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Learning is important because it helps you reach your goals in life, and studying is not my thing but imagination helps me with studying because I can imagine the things we talked about. Reading books is more important to me because it cheers me up when I am mad so I don't pop off and say things I regret saying ",human
"During years had been existed a question among be yourself and be like the people wants you to be; in this time I'm agree with the author when he say,"" to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment in this world that is trying constantly to make you someone else,"" because there is a lot of people that shows indifference with you, only because of the way you think , or for simples things like how you wear, the music you like, or how you like to live.

Be yourself is one of the best things that exists in this world, because you don't have to act different in front of the other people just to be accepted, one of the advantages to be yourself is, if you are loved by someone for how you are, you don't be afraid to hurt that person because of your bad actions.

Otherwise, we also can get benefits for being how the world wants you to be, for example in your job, you are getting pay for all your effort working hard although you want to do it or not.

Nevertheless, in this world we alway are controlled by someone no matter what. Beliefs, the law, or parents; and it's necessary to be controlled because they are teaching us how we have to be in a good way.

Although there are obstacles that are trying to not let you to be yourself, always is better no matter what is in front of you, it feels confortable without conceal of nobody, that's why I think to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment.

First of all students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some have to work and they dont have time to attend to school because of their schedule.

Second reason is that students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because they have family, that could be a problem for them since they could have kids and have to take care of them and being able to study from their houses it's a great a option for them.

And last reason, because others live far away. sometimes students dont have transportation because of their location or maybe they don't even have school in the area, and online classes it's an good advantage for them and good opportunity to study.

"Summer is the time for students to take a break from school, but some educators feel that summer break is too long and it needs to be shorten. As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle.

First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again.

Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love!

Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break.

On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this. Students need to have some times to release their stress after a long year at school by visiting their family or doing whatever they like.",human

"Well I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is with your family and friends making some hamburgers, hot dogs, carne asada, tacos, and barbacoa. Play games like soccer, football ride a bike, make running races with your friends, or baseball, play music but not so loud because the police may come, invite you son/daughter boyfriend/girlfriend and their parents to come to the park, maybe bring some snacks for the afternoon. Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people don't have family and friends and there are all alone that's why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and than eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the you are having fun fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while their are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk yo relax your brain and refletionate and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because thats where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.

"Can we accomplish more if we are always doing something ?

Sometimes we are lazy and we don't want to do nothing, but if we are doing always something we can be more stronger and helpful to the citizen.

Sometimes we are lazy, but that is bad in our life because we has to learn about this life and prepare for the future and other things. One day we would grow up and we would does not know anything and we're gonna fall in our life, therefor i told them this advice.

Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

we can be stronger if we are always doing something because we can learn about everything that we did and we can get strength to be better, also we can be a adviser to other peoples for example: Kids, Teenager, also Adults.

We can be helpful if we are always doing something because one day that we fall down, also we can stand up more stronger and healthy. We can help person with our experiences, also we can help kids give them a advise because we want a good, strong citizen in this world and they can make it better, and help each other.

In conclusion we can be stronger, healthy for people that don't know anything in this life. We can do better things for our future, furthermore kids will be our future, therefore we are gonna fight for them, and their future because if we are lazy and we don't do anything we are gonna fail. We need more activities in our life and do something all the time because for that we can learn ah be adviser, also we need a break but we has to continue learning and to be success in our life, and complete our dreams.",human
"Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

Sencerly, YOUR S",human
"Being Against An Extended School Day

-

Generic_Name

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

"People believe that students should take music or drama class and i am agree with them because some students like to play instruments and some of them like to enjoy drama events and a lot of students like to draw even if they're not good drawing but they try and that's why they should take art class and the same thing with students who likes to play instruments. But the problem is if a student want to take those classes they have to ask for a permission from their parents first, because a lot of students want to take the class but their parents they're don't agree with their children and also sometimes to take those classes its need time and some kids don't have compassion to take it easy and they ruined it. But many students love to play instruments and they usually give their time on it and they learn with time practicing.

For example, A lots of students like to play sports for school and they talk with their parents first if they can play and also, if the parents agree with their children decision and the same thing with music class,drama,art etc. Because for those kind of stuff always need time. But i am agree with people who believe that students should required to take music,drama and art class because they can learn something new in their life and someday they can find a job to be an artistic or musician to play song in any events and drama they can get to record for the TV shows and that will be a good job for them in the future.

Those people who think that students should take classes for music,art,drama they support their children that's why they want their kids to take it and that's the good thing because they give the permission and a opportunity to their children to learn.",human
Have you ever learned about hyperbaly and onmanpia? To some who haven't these are what they mean hyperbaly is something you would compare to like for an example he bacame more red than this chile. Their is lots of way to use hyperbaly. What does onmanpia mean? It's an sound affect you would see when you are reading a book or watching a cartoon here are some examples for this word the owl whoosh away flying as quick whoosh is a sound affect when watching a cartoon you could seen the character falling then you see the word boom when he falls. People really get confused with simile or metaphor when they see it or and personafaction and hyperbaly it almost means the same thing but they are not. Onmanpia it the easiest but hard the write half of the people that first start to learn this have a hard time one. saying it's name or two. writing it because for sure I did. What is simile? well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two thing they are comparing it too and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldn't be a simile. You could say as I was walking I stumble across an old friend of mine your using as in the sentence that's a metaphor. It is important for you to know this so when you are reading or watching t. v or something this lesson will remind you about what you just learned. Personafaction is a long and confusing word but the meaning for this long word is almost the same as hyperbaly y'all already know what's the meaning but personafiction is used in sentences like the clouds don't look very happy they look mad the meaning for this is that it looks like it's about to rain. really tricky to not get hyperbaly or personafaction correct.,human

"Homework Clubs

Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills.

First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didn't really do my homework and I knew that I didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didn't like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded.

Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done.

Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didn't know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didn't need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didn't know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way.

I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",human
"I agree that its hard to Impressions is impossible to change because my First experiences and the example is that when i was 16 and my first day of working with my uncle and i work on delivered marble,materials to the person who needed something to fixing the problem As a result on my first day and experiences it went well and OK because i was a little nervous that something is going to be wrong that i may say something wrong and i don't know what to do when the person say you got the one materials and tools. On my second day at work my boss told me to go help the other workers and i did and i grab the big marble table and put it on the truck and tied the rope and rap tightly so it won't fell down but when i was going to jump out of the truck and rope was ripping apart and the table got broke in half the consequently that means we clean the mess and throw it away and grab another marble to cut it in a right shape and size and delivered and fast as we can to make it one time and that is one of my scary experiences because i was scared that my boss will get mad at me and the other workers it a good thing that we work together to finished the job and the mistake we had to fix. And boss tell my dad that he did a good job and impression like his dad use to do my Father was very proud that did very well at work for the past 3 days because i work there for 5 hours and very fun and a good experience and they teach me out to use the tool the right way and how to use it properly and those people help me a lot and a pleasure to work there on the marble shop as a worker and made few new friends an that job.",human
"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because some people are comfortable where they are. It is alway good to go beyond your comfort zone and explore new thing. Without explore you will never know what you are cable of and you will never grow in life. It good to be satify where you are sometime, But when emergency come to need to explore to see who you truly are. He is also right because where Iam from lot of people are satify where they in life life.

I believe that the more you explore the more you grow. For example If Bill Gate was satify what he master with out exploring he would had never become a billionaire and he would never discovered the microsoft. And if

Barack Obama was satify with his education/knowledge he would never had became a Senator or the first Black

African American president of America and he was never going to be able to share is idea with America .So with out going beyond what you have mastered you will never know who you are and what you are cable of. Explore beyond what you have mastered and there will alway be a suprise , a new talent and a new growth in life. You will never discovered your worth/talent with out trying. Some people have that mind set that if they explore they will never make it. The more you explore the farther you go in life. Always pray to advanced to a new level not the level you have master. My mom alway tell me never be happy where you at step out of your comfort zone and explored.

So you will know who you truly are. For example if your boss is leave and they are looking for a new replacement for his/her position and you have knowledge/idea about the job, but you decided embrace where you are because you are scared to take a step in life. And you also have the mind set that they will turn you down. Some people in college are comfortable having there master degree but scared to get their doctorate degree because they feel that having their masters degree is the stopping point of their learning skills and they are not smart enough to get their doctorare degree. Some enviroment make you satify where you at.

Being happy with where you at is not a bad thing but the more you explored the more you grow in life. Never be happy with who you are alway fight for a better future on a better life. like Neil Armstrong Said "" a gaint leap for man kind"" some people need to take that gaint leap in their life. The more you explore the more you learn about life and where it will take you.",human
"I have heard that many people gets bully by others people sometimes, and which is I don't understand, why this it happens probably for the color of you're skin and we all are the same just the color of the skin is different. Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who gets bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and thats a bad situation.

But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens and I ask my self why? this happens sometimes, probably its because we are different than they are or they feel more stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably thats why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you.

And I understand that its hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and its hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied i thin k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who gets bullied by someone, I think thats something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people.

What should we do about bulling collaborate to stop we should stop because, it can cause bad situation to those people who are bulling other they can go to jail for the reason they make fun of others, why they can go jail because those poor people who are getting bullied they could kill themselves and thats why they can go to jail its a bad thing thats what can happen to them if they don't stop bulling           ",human
"Do you want to know some enjoyable ways to do at the park? Well, at the park you can walk your dog, you can have a picnic with family or friends, some parks have animals you can look at, and you can ride your bike, skate board, and scooter.

One enjoyable thing to do at the park is, you can walk our dog. While you are walking your do, you are also getting some exercise by walking with them. It's also fun because the dog can explore new places to go to.

Also it's somewhere you can take your dog to go out and enjoy nature with you. Some dogs like walking, so a park is a good place to take them to go walk. Also you and your dog can have some time together.

Another enjoyable way to do at the park is, you can have a picnic with your family of friends. Having a picnic is fun because you get to talk to the person with you and eat with them. Having picnics at the park can be good for example, the weather when it is hot or warm or it is a beautiful day outside. When you are done with your picnic you can go and explore more of the park. If you brought someone with you and they never been there before then they might like it and they would want to come back again.

Third enjoyable way to do at the park is, some parks have animals you can look at. It is enjoyable to look at the animals for example, the bears, fishes, turtles, goats, chickens, and pigs. You can also go look at the pig races. There could be some animals you may have never seen before. Sometimes when you go see the animals at the park some people can tell you some stuff to learn about the animal like where is is from or what it eats and you can feed the animal food that the park provides them to eat.

Last but least, you can ride your bike, stake board, and scooter. At the park you can learn how to ride the the thing you brought and practice. The park is also a safer place because there won't be a lot of cars. While you are riding on what you brought with you, it is fun to ride it while you see the beautiful features of the park. It is a good place to go and play with your friends with bikes, skate boards, and scooters because the park is safer than the street and might be a big park to play at with your friends.",human
"PROMPT

Asking multiple people can give you more ideas and it could be a lot smarter asking for advice. Therefore you were writing a main idea and your main idea was just the hunted house and if you go and ask people for a good spooky main ideas they can come up with main ideas you have not even thought about. However if you got a group and ask them to come up with ideas every one will many ideas and you can just figure out which idea is the best.

Manner-better choices

It can sometimes be hard if someone is trying to make a better choice. Like if your being bad and your teacher gave you an advice and the advice was to do all your work and to behave and your grade will increase. Your going to have to make a better choice to behave or not behave. And if you cant pick you can just go and ask other people if you should start behaving more in class. One of the guys says one day your going to become a leader one day and he will have to be a good person.

Tone- expiring

Seeking multiple options can help you in a good way because it can give you more ideas,something you never thought about, something thats new that came to mind, making a better choice, more details that come to mind.

Therefor you were doing a group project. The teacher would want you to form a group because when your doing your project. The other students that are working with you on the class project they can come up with new details about the project. And you project will get completed fast that you will have more ideas you wanted to add for the project. Like if your were doing a project about any animal your group would pick the animal they know mostly about. Then you come up with a idea and you think its not a good idea. Then just ask you group and they will tell you if your idea is good and add it on the project.

But if you gives us the chance to be in your hospital for one day. My dream will finally come true.

I swear that my life will be better if you let us be in there. Maybe you had a dream too, and I suppose that it was not easy to became a professional doctor. Was it? So can you please make my dream true and give me the first steep to be a professional person. I know is kind of hard to ask you to let us be in your clinic because I know you are a busy person. But I just want to know a little bit about medicine. I know you are a great surgeon, that is the why I am asking you to teach me. I know that it is not easy to be the hospital's manager and surgeon but there if you can. I'll too.

Thank you for listen to me. Have a wonderful day!

"People around the world have thought about the way students should be teach or the way they should be treated but a few have notice that many students are struggling to build self-esteem. Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents' help. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising student's deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students.

According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably won't help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote.

However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friend's brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life.

Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever.

In addition, praising student's deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year.

In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the student's best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements,

Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work. Every people have different thoughts about how a student should be teach but whatever they choose will influence their children's life forever.",human
"Others would not appreciate kindness.

First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment.

Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just don't show what kindness really looks like.

Finally it's not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad.

Kind isn't always the best choice.

First being kind isn't always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help.

Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around it's easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school.

Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering.

Don't be kind to those who aren't good people

First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore don't talk to them and shouldn't be kind to them.

Also a reason to not be kind to those who aren't good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right.

Finally if you are getting annoyed by the person who is being mean to you than talk to a teacher about it and they can talk to the student about being kind to others.",human
"I agree that some district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of 4, some students don't have enough money or they don't want to go to college. Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life.

Nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest. Some teenagers just don't want to be at school for years they don't like school, this program help them have more time to experience, try new things, prepare them for what they want to do and how they want to do it.

"Thomas Jefferson said. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. But you can get all this if you work hard and. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special. Because you always are looking for something more than one. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live.  ",human
"Why should you accomplish anything in your live? In another words, why should you finish anything in your live? You need to accomplishment to get your purpose. When you done something in your life you will be successful, not boring, and proud of yourself. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and that's not true.

It's a great thing to be successful in your live. "" Don't work hard but work smart"". In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever.

When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Being active all the time is healthy. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you don't get board of your life. Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. For example, I go play soccer so I wouldn't get board in my life. If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live.

Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time.

In my opinion people accomplish when they always doing something . Always do your work and finished so you can success. Always work hard and keep yourself busy so you couldn't get boring. I know that some people will degree with me, but that's okay because everyone have different opinions, and my opinion was if you didn't work hard you will not get what you want. Let yourself work hard, so you can accomplish you work and success in your life. The best thing in life that you done work and proud of your work. Always accomplish your work and get it done so you can be a successful person.        ",human
"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea.

First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school.

Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somwhere in life.

While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college.

However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future.

To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help. ",human
"As I know the Music,Drama, and Art classes are not mandatory to take. the leaners at education area can take these classes for their choices. infact it is a elective not mandatory. so the leaners can take these subject as a elective. for example: if a student take an art class infact he/she is not take it as a required class he/she take it for their choice and wants to get extra credit. or if a person has 4 required classes and and he/she take a art class instead one of the 4 classes and he/she thaught this is the 4 classes that i need for graduation indeed they are going to take a wrong class because as we know the art classes is not needed for graduation. so we have to take a class that we needed for graduation.

Although some educator take the art or music classes off course seniors because they might be have less classes. in this case they choose these classes as choice and the junior can take these as well to get extra credit.

lets talk about the required classes:

require classes are: English11,geometery,math,CIS,world history,and etc...

these classes that students need to take it and complete the school credit and recived a better score for graduation.

each subject has different SOL test.

when the students reach to those classes they need to pass the SOL test as well as SOL is one of the important part of required classess that leaners need to pass it during a year. the SOL test comes twice for students off course!

they have to recived over 300 score which can allowed to take it again. so that is the required classes which is a student learn in a year.

although we have a electives classes such is Art,Drama Music and etc but we can not counted on required classes. So Art,Drama, and Music are not necessary to take it as required classes those should be electives that leaners can choose as favorate subject for their future.",human
"Should students take the programs that the school district is offering, which is to allow student to graduate high school in only three years instead of taking full four years.

It is clear that finishing high school in just three years can be the best opportunity. One can be to get high school out of the way. Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, and etc.

However, not all student would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Some, of course, may think that you're not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, you're only taking extra courses during the whole summer, that's like saying you're missing a whole ten months of school. In addition if I were to take this program, I would really do as much as I can during the summer courses, and courses to get extra credits that i need for the colleges that I;m applying to. and soon I'll start working, and apply for a scholar ship, also applying to universities or colleges that i would like to attend to,

In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors,work, so therefore, I'd recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you. I can assure one can accomplish something for their goal in the future. ",human
"I think that finish high school in three year is a really good idea, because I can go early to the college, and I don't lost time. One reason is my friend Generic_Name, who finish high school early, and now he's done with college; Additional,

he says that finish high school is very good because he got more time to work but not everyone think like him.

Therefor my others friends who think that is not good, because they need go prepared to the college, so they says if I finish early high school I can't go prepared to the college; Another reason is that no body want lost time, for that reason my friend Generic_Name finish high school early, but many youngest are lazy.

Every school need offer that program, the program is really important because can help a lot students to finish high school early; Also, a lot student want finish early.

I think that everyone need take the program, because the students got more time to work, and to learn too, so the program is a big help for the students who take it. My friend Generic_Name ad others friends who I know, they are benefit. One year is a long time, in one year early they can got more money and more everything.",human
"I agree with Author Emerson because people can do what they think makes them happy, they will support what they believe in without fearing anything, and they will speak up for themselves. Emerson's quote is saying that we live in a world with many influences trying to change who you are , so to retain your individuality or who you are is a great magnanimous feature. Most people end up striving to change themselves to fit standards to portrayed by media or to try to impress someone, however I think that people who choose not to change, and to be themselves are the accomplished ones. Other people will be inspired to become like you if you exceed to be yourself and not care what others think of you , and you should do what makes you comfortable. By you going against what everyone thinks is normal , you are showing that you are happy about who you are and you will stand out , out of all the other people trying to be someone they are not.

"Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I was so successful in life. You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy.

First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name.

Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Name's makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese.

Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him.

You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I benefited from always doing something productive instead of being inactive. Help me spread the word that always doing something is more beneficial and healthy than being inactive.",human
"Some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing something because if they are then they might not have time to do the other work they are given or they might be busy with the hard work first then maybe finish the work. But inactivity also serve as a purpose because some people aren't doing anything so they have time to finish and accomplish something because they are not doing anything

The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work.

The first reason why people accomplish something when they are doing something is because they work and don't waste time at school or work but sometime. The second reason is that they don't accomplish work when they are doing something because they won't have time to finish the other work or they rush ans make a lot of mistake on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so thats why some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing other things.

So inclusion some people accomplish their work and some don't also inactivity serve as a purpose for people that are done with their work but class or they are still work should not just sit there and do nothing they should get more work in till they leave the class or their jobs.",human
"I will agree with this topic I thing that can you be yourself is something can you be on our person and you most constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.

First, I thing that be yourself is something can you do in person because if you don't do that so you cannot be good person in your life. However, you most have nice personality and good respect to someone be yourself and if someone don't have affect so that person is not have good personality.

Another reason. We can do the people don't do like have good and respect to someone you have to be most confidential in yourself because you most be great person to another people in the community that mean you can have make sure people is good with that to be yourself.

Next. People can do anything to constantly to another people so that's why we need to have most confidential to make sure we need to be kind because that we need yourself to be cleanly and most respectfull and generous be to good person in the future.

Finally. Be yourself is something that's why people in the community don't respect because if yourself have to be accomplishment that's mean the you have something error. So, we need to have most confidential and generous in yourself because you have be sure the yourself nobody to compare to someone else so because you are not good person.

In conclusion. This is my reason why you have be yourself because you most have constantly our personality so you can be greafull with something you do in your life to be nice person in the future you have to respect to be good person.",human
Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace. Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day. ,human
"Do you have a high goal?

Many people have goals, someone have high goals and others have low goals.

The high goals is so hard finish it, however, we never change a high goal by a low goal only because is more easy.

Although you have one hundred low goals it's impossible say ""one hundred low goals is equal to a high goal"" because a high goal can to become successful and though you'll do one hundred low goals it's almost impossible you become successful.

It's very important have high goals in our life to be a great person, taking high goals you can to detach in anything, however, taking low goals you never can to be successful

To start, it's very important have high goals to be a great person. For example: Keanu Reeves, a susseccfuly actor, is a great person showing the money is not important with his life. some times a high goals no always is have money, also can to be a personal goal.

To next, taking a high goal you can to detach in anything. For example: Kobe Bryan, the bigger player of the NBA, was the best player in basketball because he wanted become the best. You are not the schism, if you work for you like you can to be the best in anything.

To finish, taking low goals you never can to be successful. For example: somebody having low goals never can learn of his mistakes, furthermore, that person never can to grow. but if you want to become successful you need to find anything that to feel passion and going to for that.

the high goals can be hard included impossible to reach, but, we never to give up, only you say yourself ""i can do it"" so you will be in the first step in the success'es path.",human
"World is change every second. Each year grow tree. But people cut trees faster.

Some people says to be succesful in our life person need be yourself. But, why?

Be yourself is the best way to be succesful.

But most of people don't know, how be succesful? They think that to have money they will be succesful. For example, peoples try be IT programers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people don't know, what it is and in this area most people are new. Their don't want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they trying somthing else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they don't come back to school again. Nobody don't ask ""Does student want go to school?"". And this is one of the reason, why students don't want go to school. But, those years that he was in school, he will be remind.

Most people don't know, what will be after four years. Students go to college which say their parents.

Most of us to survive in this life doing that he or she don't want. Most imigrants come to rich countries because they have money. They learn their native language just to have more money.

One person say ""Make your job what you want to do and you wouldn't work, never"". We don't think how we can be succesful? And it's make wrong desision. People think that be painter or artist is bad, because they don't have much more money. This mind is wrong. Artists are be not bad because they live by yourself.

To find yourself is hard because it take time and other people influens to other people. But when person find yourself his or her life will be happy.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

I agree, because yourself it's make life better.",human
"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study?

Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school.

In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, student's grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved.

Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying.

Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken.

In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken. ",human
"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people don't have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.

To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.

For example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.

Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.

On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.

In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",human
"Imagine this, you are at the park; although, there are a plethora of activities you can do, you are just too lazy to do any of them. Until one of your friends call you over to play over to play basketball, you decide to go and play basketball and it is on of the most fun you have had in a long time. An enjoyable activity you can do outside is play basketball because it is addictive, it can make you physically fit, and it can make you mentally fit.

First of all, you can get addicted to basketball because it's so enjoyable that once you play it, you don't want to quit. You can get so addicted to it that instead of playing once or twice a week you start playing it seven times a week, you can start playing it way more than you did a month ago. This addiction can make you enjoy basketball way more than you used to.

Next, some people enjoy basketball because if how fit you can become just from playing basketball. People find that so enjoyable becasue you can get fit and have fun from playing basketball. People even play basketball just to exercise and stretch. This leads you to working out while you run across the basketball court and shoot the ball into the hoop.

Finally, it can make you mentally fit because of how focused you are on basketball. Basically what I am saying is instead of being sad and depressed at home, you could be outside focusing on only basketball and having fun. This leads you to get rid of sadness and depression, which is why some people find this activity so enjoying.

Basketball is an activity is very enjoyable because of how addictive it is. How physically fit you can become just from playing basketball. How mentally fit you can become. There also a plethora of other reasons why people find this sport/ activity so enjoying.                       ",human

Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

And many ways I think it does, and in others I think it doesn't. It depend on the person, that's what I believe.

It has a positive effects in the way that it can help people that feel along entertain thyself without nobody, I don't think that there are many things nothing worst then feel along. that can do bad things to people brains, and I am not saying that there is nothing worst, I mean be in prison, not had a job, die... and I had seen many people who prefer all those things before then be along, and checking out book, shopping, playing games, listening music in your favorite app, Pandora... or watching you favorite show in YouTube, Netflix or whatever other app that you use is positive way of use the technology.

But you know in the worth nothing is perfect,like my grandfather used to say ""there has to be bad things, so that there could be good things"". every positive thing has to have it on negative thing.

it has a negative effect on people lives because with the advice of the technology phone, and others the people are losing the interest in norma things, like some people don't even care about family reunion. I mean I never really care about that staff neither. I always preferred to be with my cousin, and my childhood friends then be in my house talking about boring things, but now you can not have simple conversation with some people because when you are talking to them most of the time they are in they phone doing who knows what, and I don't know about you. but to me that's a disreperfull way to tell me that you don't care about what i'm saying, and that could made people dislike you.

technology is one of the greatest things ever invented, it made more easier the communication, it give entertainment to the people, it inform us of every that is happening in the worth, even in the space, and we don't have to read a whole book to find answer. technology has made every more easier, you can do almost anything, you can shopping without leave your house, order food...

and all this stuff made people lazy, maybe they ask thyself why should I do this when my small phone or computer can do it for me, why should I date someone to talk to them when I can do it by my phone, why should I have to have a conversation with somebody when there is a whole lot of thing that I can do in my phone or competed. And maybe you are going to keep asking the same question to yourself unto the day that there would be no body by your side.

In Conclusion the technology is something very good, if you use it just when you need it. not letting it get into your mind.     ",human

Last but not least three, people can see the real you.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

Sometimes pretending to be someone or something you aren't can stress you out because you feel pressured. You feel like you need everyone to like you but will you feel good about yourself pretending.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, the author who wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Why do most people agree with his quote, there could be many reasons. My reason to agree with Ralph's quote is because people can see the real you when being yourself. Not being yourself around your family, friends, and other people could make you feel less confident about yourself or your actions. Pretending can make you feel guilty, it could make you feel like you're lying to someone about yourself, so think about it.

"Have you ever group up with older or younger students before? And you think of eachother's differently and won't work it out, well there a program that helps older and younger to solve that problem.

Older students can teaches the younger students to learn the next year problems or tests that is coming up. The younger students would confuses how do the problems infront of them and would need helps. The older students help the younger students with their studies. Older students can help them read the sentences on the problems they have or help with the steps of the problem. The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past and it's stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher let's all sixth grades read with 2nd graders and it's how younger and older bonds little bit.

The younger and older students can bond eachother in the program. They can learn from eachother what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. It's a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for eachother. It's like a group project and they have to work with eachother to finish the project and helps eachother step by step.

"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

"I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about. I agree with him because if you do the same thing you Mastered you will never grow but if you do more things and then you mastered you will grow a lot.

If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that.

You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. It's good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. It's always good to do more what you Mastered in life.

In the work is very important to arrive all the time with good attitude and be amiable. The customer can stay happy with the workers work with a good attitude. The customer give tips, and the workers are happy. The workers don't have problems with the chief or the boss.

When they are graduated they remenber that it's important to be good with others and continued in to be good person with a good attitude.

Finally, in the house it's important to keep a good character with good attitude. I think that in the family is more important to have a good attitude.

"We should have after school homework club because, some students need help with their classwork, some students don't pay attention and they could use after school to understand the topic and what they have to do, and they could improve their grade for classwork and homework. For example when I was in Elementary school, I use to stay after school for homework club because I couldn't understand anything so I stayed after and got help from my teacher.

To begin with the homework club is good because for some students that need help could stay after with her/his teacher and do what they have to do with their teacher. Also they could get help by finishing their homework and classwork. Some students go home and ask their parents for help but some parents doesn't remember the question or don't know how to do it. So it's helpful for students to have homework club and get help from their teacher.

My other reason is that some students doesn't understand the question and it's hard for somebody that doesn't understand their language. For example when I came here three years ago I didn't know any English neither my parents so i had to stay after, and get help from my teacher to understand what is the question asking me to do. Another example would be when students don't pay attention in class or fall a sleep it's good for them to stay after school and get help from their teacher to understand.

Finally students could get improve by staying after and learn better. Some students have bad grade for homework or their classwork, so they could stay after to get improved. Also students can improve their understanding. For example my cousin use to have bad grade for homework, so he stayed after school, and got help from his teacher, and learn better, and got improved.

Lastly all of this reasons and details are why school should have after school homework club. Students need help with their homework and to get improve. Also some students don't have time in classrooms to ask their teacher for help so they could stay after school and get help after school. Teacher also can support students to stay after school and do their homework.",human
"To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers won't be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

I believe that, school days shouldn't be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students must be at school for eight hours. Otherwise the teachers won't have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly.

Second reason, is that teachers won't be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves

Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. Food cost will highly increase its price.

In conclusion, employers shouldn't reduce peoples hours. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away it's also affecting our economic and learning system.",human

Another example, Generic_Name has a success in her life because she has every of her goals done has a family a perfect job because she is secure of herself. Some people might say a positive attitude is not the key to be successful;however, they are wrong because the person who has a positive attitude is secure of them self and they never give up because they are secure about what goals they want to complete.

In conclusion,most of the people has to have positivism,life challenge,and been secure of our self is a form to has positive attitude and has success in our life. To be successful person we have to be with a positive attitude. Most of the people is positive when they finish their goals with success because they are secure of them self and they never give up with any challenge and they always have positivism. NEXT TIME you wants to success in your life change your attitude to a positive attitude to complete your goals and be success in your life.",human
"The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success.

Chances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day.

Having a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success.

Reaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. Elon Musk created a company named ""SpaceX"" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude.

In conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. Every individual can have a different explanation for their goal, and the goal is the positive influence in their life. Trying to make the positive influence in your life with out positive attitude is impossible. Positive attitude is the key to success.",human

Generic_City park it's located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games. One thing I would like to see as soon as I arrive is the Chocolate factory and the Lazy river that is in the Aquatic park.

As I said before, ""There are awesome attractions in

Generic_City park"" let me talk to you about this amazing roller coaster I would love to ride and the name of that roller coaster is 'The Super dooper looper'.

The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But that's just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place.

The chocolate factory shows you the process of how they make that delicious chocolate, you can see everything there, from the beginning to the end, that is one of the best places I would love to go because you can't only see how they make chocolate, you can also buy it and feel the taste of the best chocolate ever 'Kisses'. The chocolate 'kisses' is one of my favorite chocolates that's why I would like to see the chocolate factory.

"Why should students identify their career by the time they enter high school?

some people say that Students should identify their career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward their future life. Students could study on their future work, to become better and have a better knowledge on what they do,get more money and respect at the same time. one student may thing of Ben a Doctor but have no idea how to come one of this dream work so this students take biology class or others student can think of Ben a manager this student have a chance of been one because in high school that teach blitheness classes or economy class. students have many chose in high school to become who they want to be.

Students also could learn how to take responsibility by doing a little things like doing their Class work, Home work, and also by doing some school activities. students are mostly scored to take a responsibility by them safe but doing a little thing can Chang every thing for their future.

Students could be participating in sport at their school, they can be playing profession in the future or even while their in high school. they can get a scuoralship by playing any tap of sport at the same time they can have fun. in one school there are many kind of sports like soccer,basketball,voliball,tennis,racte,etc... sport can help one student mentally or phicaliy. most student experse theirs elf by using sport, that make friends, becoming one big family.

However some people things that it is a good timing for students to identify their career by the time they enter high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward their future life. some do not thing it is a good thing to do. As some people said making teenagers chose his/her career is wrong because teenagers age is what old people call it as ""The fire age"" to make big chose like this, so they can west their time doing something that was not meat for them. some people come up with some idea like counselors make a good chose bathed on their grad in midel school,or wait for the students to finish 9th grade than make a chose for him/her the best thing to study instead of the students making wrong choice.

"what do you think about a program that school provides to pair the younger students with the older students? It can be a exellent choice for the younger students and the older students. Therefore, many younger students have less experience than the older students, so the older students have more experience than them. Older student have already halfway done going to the school. Also, it has a great effect on them to be a good students. This program would help both the older and the younger student in responsibilities, socialization and improving behaviors.

Certainly, this program could help both the older and the younger student in taking care of their own responsibilities. They both can get some useful knowledge that it might be helpful for them to take care of their responsibilities. It could make a good change on how they used to do their chores and homeworks. Taking care of responsibilitis is hard but if they work together than it will get more easier and better on it. It will make them productive and helpful on doing works. Like I said, it will also be useful for their future, when they will have job and other things to do.

however, this program could help both the older and the younger students in socialization. It will make a great change on how they used to work in group. Usually, younger students don't like to talk to the older students, so it can make them be more confident to talk to others. Some older and younger students like to be anti social but if they join the program and work together than it will make them social. It will make a good impact in spending time with others and playing outdoor games. Also, it will effect them in good way to make some new friends.

Therefore, this program will also help both the older and younger students in improving behaviors. If the older students are not respecting and talking polite with others than it will change them. Like I said, it will also help them both improve on how they used to treat other peoples. It will help them to speak a good langauge and be nice to the people they don't know. Also, it will have a good impact on their future when some students will like to a teacher when they grow up and teach their students about behaviors.

In the conclusion, this program could be really helpful for both of them. It could effect both of them to learn something new that they have not know about yet. Therefore, it could be a great program for the school to start and earn money. This program could develope their minds in a good way that will impact their future and their daily life. It could be great and wonderful to learn the things that the students have been struggling in. Also, it will lead them to be a good students and a good person when they grow up. ",human
"Topic:

Influencing others.

Argument:

Influence is a big word. It has a lot of meanings. It has a lot of ways to describe.

Position:

Mi position is negative for the word influence. It gets othes in wrong ways. It is the word that convince othes to do somthing.

For example:

Somebody offer you some beer, wine, or drugs that are bad influence. If a friend say to you, hey come on lets stole that bicicle it's a bad influence. I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donal's, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

Conclusion:

In my conclusion I think that influencing others is not good because it to force many people to do several things wrong. It convince many children to go throught bad ways. However, the word influence can be exellent too. It can describes many things that can be good in your work or in your life.                                                      ",human
"Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning.

Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better.

We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. For example,

you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits.

Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something it's frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people

In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things ",human

"What is something you would like to do in the future? Well I for one want to become a forensic scientist later on in life. Now others, just wish for money or want the job that pays the most but I do not. I want this job because I think I could really be happy with this job, I could feel like i have a purpose in life with that job, also as an added bonus I could be near the police force, and i have always admired the police force because of their bravery. thats why this is going to be what I want to accomplish.

First and foremost, I want this job because I could truly be happy. I love working by myself because I would get to work at my own pace and not have to worry about slowing down for others. And I really feel this is a good way of helping to get justice without getting in the action. For example I could help the police catch criminals by helping with fingerprinting. And thats why I feel I could be happy with that job.

Additionally, I would take that job because I would always get to be around the police force. And I admire them so much for their courage and bravery. something that we have in common is that we both want to help people. One time i saw someone take someones purse and the police officer chased him and pinned him down and returned the purse. The way I see police officers is that they love to help other people.

Lastly, and the most important to me, in this job I would get to feel that I am helping people on a regular basis by getting justice for them. Because most of the time I just hate myself for not helping others more often. People deserve better than me but I can not change over night so all I can do right now is hope, that in the future I can be better. But in the meantime the things I can do are the little things because those are the things that count the most.

"If you wake up a day and you asked yourself what make a person different than other let me tell you that you are not the only one there are many other asked the same ( which is weird). But like John Lubbock says "" your character will be what yourself choose to make it"". I agree with John Lubbock because is important that you have to choose what will be your character traits and this are my reason. Firts reason is you create your own personality. The second reason is the you are not monotonous. And the last reason having others people respect.

When we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying). Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when don't permit the other people influeneces with idea.

When a person is monotonous is they don't a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he don't put a different style or a different color.

Some people may says that be differentof the other people is no important. However having your own personality is very important and that is my tird reason, having your own personality can get other people respect and some is gonna says the why you are talking about. Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I don't belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be ""cool"" you will respect him (I don't believe).

"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.

"To. Principal,

My opinion about this change is a good idea. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades. A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.

Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

Instead we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing. A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to. So if i pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is and the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much others.

"Enjoyable educational activities are really good source of learning and doing something fun. Saying so, it's a really good idea that we can get the chances or we can do the activities anywhere, anytime we like.

Activities are or can be educational, many activities can help a lot, on something someone missed or failed a subject in school. It helps the brain work a little harder then other basic stuff that aren't educational. School activities are really educational in many ways, anything that helps or can helps study on anything. Studying is a great reason why we can do fun activities with the subject someone wants to relearn, practices, or just for the feels of it.

Participating on an activities, sports is a great why to participate, not only that is good for the heath, but to socializes. Activities is an easy way to make friends and socializes. Participating in activities can allow to share opinions, or give ideas on something. Participating is a good why to show efforts on something someone is working on in a group of people.

Working in groups, makes the activities fun and more enjoyable. Enjoyable is that someone can talk to their partner or teammate. Being in groups of teams or just a group of people in activites, makes the groups work together. (?)

Not only activities are just to learn and educate, but activities can be fun and enjoyable. Activities can be extremely fun if you give it the efforts of playing, or know how to play. Fun activities can turn into fights or arguments. It's all ways good that we, or someone know how to handle it. The good way for that to never happen is that we need to be respectful, and show kindness to our partner so we don't have problems in our group activities.    ",human

I can fix people if they have any medical problems in life. I was reading books about doctors and I started to get interested becoming one. Being a doctor is alot of hard work, I love doing hard work because hard work makes you pay off. My parents told me don't do something what you think it's fun, do something what you love, what I want to do and love to do in life is to become a doctor.

I sometimes mainly do hard work because of money, one of my main goals is to get alot of money. I need money to buy a house, have children, and taking care of my family. Doctors get alot of money when they do hard work, it's not easy to become one. Hard work makes you feel tired, but at the same time you relax and get alot of money. Money is not important in life, when you have alot of money, the first thing I think about is family first, then I think anything I want on the second thought.

My uncle is a doctor, I learn alot from him how you become a doctor. He told me to read some of the doctor books at this age and then when I get to my senior year, that's when he told me to think about becoming a doctor. How my uncle become a doctor is he going to medical school for 7-8 years, but I want to be different from him, I want to become a surgeon and a doctor. My uncle is just a doctor, but he still works for surgeons but dosen't do actual surgery to people. My uncle was the one who got me most interested becoming a doctor.

I would mostly become a surgeon than a doctor because I read mostly about surgeries and it get me even more interested. Surgery is not that disgusting when you get used to it, that's why I read alot of surgeon books. When I first thought of surgery, I thought it was really disgusting, but then my uncle told me alot about it, then I stopped the disgusting part. My favorite part about surgery is fixing people, I feel happy that i'm fixing the person. The main reason why I want to become a surgeon is because I want to get alot of money to take care of my family, and I want to help people in life.                  ",human
"I strongly believe art classes such as drama, acting, and music should not be a requirement for students. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.

First of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Which in fact they are wrong student shouldnt have to take the art classes to begin with.

In my true opinion student should have the chance to express his or her true feelings, and reach a main goal in life. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it. Again arts should not be a requirement for students it is unethical, and unheard of as far as i know.

Music, drama, and art class are three amazing electives, and forever will be electives. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass? No sense in my opinion art allows us students to express out inner happiness, deepest emotions, and embrace them. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. What use will it be to us students in the real world? No use at all, unless a student wants to fallow a career path in art.

All the more reasons why I know art classes such as drama, acting, and music classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future. ",human

First,Why limitation of contact to the use of technology is important and has positive efects; It seems to me that , when i used to much my phone i feel so pain in my eyes and head because i didn't had limitation of contact to the use of my phone. And phone,computers .... is part of technology to help people contact with each other and we should have limitation of contact to using these techonlogy when we need , we can use technology.

Second, limitation of humans contact to the use of technology good for our health and body because when we use alot our body going to hurt and we always feels sick and we can not eath food as much is we need, feell deperessed.

that's why limitation of humans contact to the use of technology has positive efects. For example some people destoiyerd their eyes because of using to mach technology.

Third,what inforamtion can give us technology in our entire life. technology is the biggest things which is we need in our life to do,technology is not the only using phones, computer, robots.. technology can change our life without technology we can not contact the world with humans and information about world.

"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn.",human
"How the humans use the technology.

The technology in the world is change all time or each year, sometime people use the phone with excessive time; practically we live on red social. The cellphone it's the first device that the humans use more time in the world.

How we can see at the pass to the years the technology advance to fast around to the world, and thanks to the technology we forget how is the content in a book; in my personal opinion is happens.

I think that the technology was some revolutionary for the humanity because the technology come to make the life more easy to the humans in the world. We are blinds because we prefer pass more time in the phone than pass more time with our family, we dedicate our time in red social, where only we are lose the time.

In conclusion the technology was a benefit very important in the humanity, we need to learn how use the internet with responsibility, and understand how the technology change the world; like help us to care the planet, but I think we are did the against because we are lose our time all thanks at the reds socials, we need to know that the technology is a creation of the human to did the life more easy in the world. All what I can said is thanks to my ante past for create the technology that today in day I use for my benefit, each day I learn something new thanks to the technology.",human

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

"Dear principal i am writhing this letter, to aprove your oppinion about changind the school menu because is something good for the school and for the student, to try something different, and something healthier, some student would like the idea of changing the food menu because they have been eathing the same food over the first day of school, and other would not like the idea of changing the menu because they have already have they favorite food, but most of the student would be happy, to change the food menu to something better, and it is a good idea, because some studend dont eat at the the school lunch, instead they go ouside the school to buy food at the restaurant, and other make they onw food at home to eathed at the schoo, in my oppinion it will be better to try something new to see what it would happend in the futere and how the student would react on the change of the lunch menu, instead of eathing the same food every year of schoo, it cand be a bad thing or a good idea changind the school menu for example it may be worse and student would dont like it or it cant be good and more student would eat the school lunch.",human
"One day a random lady came up to me and called me gorgeous, and it made my day even better. The small things matter to someone. It helped me to show kindness to others because it impacted me and I want to impact others. Once you show small acts of kindness it can lead you to a better life. When people show small acts of kindness it can help someone's attitude to improve,

it can make someone's day better, help someone become a better person, and can help someone going through some hard times.

Showing small acts of kindness can help someone's attitude to improve by doing things that make them happy. Telling them what's wrong to say to someone so they know to not say it. Show love towards them because the attitude they have might may be really bad, but showing them love can help it improve a lot. Finally, they will slowly improve it might take time. The most important part is having a good attitude towards them even if you think it's not going to help it is because you're showing them how to give a good attitude back to anyone.

Helping someone's day better is by giving them a compliment it can effect them in the most positive way you can think off. Text them good morning and good night because you never know if there having a rough morning and night shows that you care. If you see them sad give them the biggest hug it can easily bright up there mood. Showing them acts of kindness can help them show kindness to others. SPREAD KINDNESS ALL OVER THE WORLD!!!! you won't regret it.

Showing acts of kindness will not just benefit the person , but it will also make you a better person. Helping someone become a better person can be easy or it can be hard it depends the way you do it. Doing little things can easily make someone a better person by giving them a smile or a hug. Once you helping someone become a better person can help you as well ! Most important is be yourself nobody is perfect in this world is okay take a deep breath and relax everyone cares for you.

Finally, a small acts of kindness can help going through some hard times is by being there for them in general you never know what there going through. Ask what's wrong and if there not comfortable telling you let them take their time it might be hard for them at first but they'll get used to it. Hang out with them 24/7 keep them active so they can forget everything they been thinking off recently. Be there for their family's as well they can also be going through a lot too. How can you show small acts of kindness to others?                     ",human
"I personally think that student should chose there on summer projects because is not going to be as much fun if a teacher choose it. I dont think students are going to do there summer project if is something boring. If student do something there interesting on they are going to do research and finish there project on time because went summer hits not many student are interesting on doing work. I think that is going to be fun doing something i like and not something the teacher wants us to do.

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun. They would be some student that is going to be boring or they won't go out as much and not see animals at all. I think student should just pick the topic they think is going to be fun for them and they are going to enjoy reaching about whatever they want to learn. Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school. I just think is a way to learn about something you want not what the school wants us to learn.

I think this is a good way to make all the students to learn something they enjoy doing. You are going to do a interesting project the you are going to like and is just fun to learn new things. you are going to learn even more by doing something fun.",human
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is something you know, imagination is anything you want to see. When you were a kid you had imagination it was with you when you were born, knowledge you have to learn. With imagination you can believe anything, new ideas are made with imagination, imagination is fun.

You can believe anything you want with imagination. What is imagination? Its something you imagine for example an imaginary friend. Something not real but you see it no one else can see your imagination. You can make your brain think whatever you want you control it. You want to believe your touching a teddy bear, than you just imagine it and feel it. Our imagination is in our brains with us it's something you're born with something only you can see it, feel it, and only you can imagine it.

Ideas happen because of imagination you can think of new ideas for a movie or anything. Some people just have a bigger imagination then us but we all think unique. Everything we have in earth is because imagination happened. Those people think ""what do we need, what can help me."" First you gotta imagine it, then you have to believe, and finally you do it.

Imagination is fun just let it take you where ever you want. its something you're born with not something you learn. Take vantage of it.

That's why i think Imagination is more important then knowledge. You have it with you, you just need to let it shine. Just image anything. Don't be afraid to show your imagination. Just do it and keep imaging, you imagination can take you anywhere you want.",human
"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.

One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students can't multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.

For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.

Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. They wouldn't stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because it'll stress them out.

Last reason, students shouldn't take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.

Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama.                                                                                                                                 ",human
"Imagine if you could do school from home and have time to relax or do more stuff. I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.

A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.

All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.

Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.

Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             ",human
"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.",human
"This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.

We would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.

We might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.

Some people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.

Finally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result.          ",human

"I believe Thomas Jefferson is right. If we are always doing something we get things done faster and there is possiblilities of starting new things. Why should we wait to finish something we can finish the same day, we never know what can happen. I also believe the inactivity is good not only does it give a chance to rest but we also can think through our ideas. We can perfect things we didnt think we could. It can give a chance to see different views of are own ideas. Maybe taking a break can refresh are memories and remind us how important things are to us. Woring all the time can exshuased ours bodys and make us think a little less. With a fresh mind set it can make things easier than we thought. Sometimes we over thinks that aren't that big of a deal and a big part of it comes from not taking the time to rest and refresh our memories. Many people would agree with Thomas Jefferson just like I do but would also agree that taking time to rest is also getting things done. ",human
"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.

First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. That's why I think elective classes was important.

secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.

In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.

Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.

Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.",human
so another reason i agree one is because the most technologist people who makes technology are the most smartest people in the work. the brains of them help them out .it dont mater what is the technology this day are the matter is that one of the time technology dont work. we cant live without technology . the people know that technology the day are best thing .that ever happened in this world .and those who complete the world. i s thnk that we the reason we need technology is because its vey important to have technology becaus ein case an emergency had happened at work school somewhere else you will need ur phone to contact the pwrsom ur friend police station second i agree because technology makes you famouse to have the category .the technoly make u ven beter ur brian pople have the smtest barin in the wold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,human
"Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.  ",human
"Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. It is a good idea for teens to take the three year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three year program. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.

The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year.

In the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. it is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three year program to advance quicker to their future goals.",human
"My mother's uncle Generic_Name wanted to be a lawyer, he did all the step that everyone do for go to college and he started work hard for pay all his classes. Generic_Name woke up every day early in the morning and he went at the college, after he took a bus for his job. After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,we'll never grow because we'll never have the enough experience and a better quality of life.

First,we'll never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience we'll have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesn't matter that we good.

Second,We'll have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others. we'll have all the thing that one day we wanted an the most important thing we'll have the power to help other. For example,when we continue learning more and more we'll stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way.

In summarize,I'm agree with Emerson's statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday. The success,the opportunities,better condition of life and the happiness is part of never stop grow. Is really important for everyone be happy with ourselves is like wake up every morning see us in front the mirror ,and say I can be better tomorrow.",human
"Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.""

Some say if ""You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.

Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!

Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.

In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions.                         ",human
"A good attitude is one of the most important things in life, because when you talking or do something with the best attitude you can see how everything is going great, and people feels good and comfortable with you. In the same time, it can open a lot of doors for you, and it can be a good opportunity for be a successful.

On the other hand, people believe that have a good attitude all the time is not a good idea, because some people will make use you, but most of the people who think like that don't have a success life; most of that people in the future feel depressing, feels like they don't do nothing with you life, they are not sucessful, and is something that every person needs thing about, you need prove that you can do it, that you can be a professional, and that you are more than people thing of you, because you need show people that is nothing imposible in life, that all your goals and dreams can makes real.

For example, a person work in a restaurant and you have a good attitude with the customers, you make them feel like in home, not waiting too long for their drinks and food, you will show them that you really happy for have them in there; in the other side, a person who works in the restaurant, don't smile to the customer, make they feel uncomfortable, and don't care about their drinks and food they don't going back to the restaurant or don't choice you for be their waitress, because you don't have a good attitude with your customers.

Also, make yourself a successful person, a person who the people want to talk, a person who a company want to you for work there, a person who do all ther goals and dreams, and a person who love himself, because you got love yourself, respect yourself, and try your best every single day, that is really impotant in your life. The attitude make you go for the best or wrong way, the best give you the best opportunity for a successful person; however, the bad give you the the work in where you do feel good, and where the best part of your day is when you go to the bathroom and use you phone for a couple minutes, when you got to life for check to check, that is the life of people who think the attitude is no the key of success, everyone don't reserve that, they reserve be happy, and have a good life with the people they love.

Is the same way in shool, talking about teacher and students, ""respect if you want respect back"", most of the students always have attitute with their teacher, they never respect them, but they want respect, a good attitude in school is the best thing we can do, because the teacher will help you more if they see you respect and really want to work, you are the person who need good grades, if you have a good attitude you will se the process in your life, in your classes, and your home. Also, in home, their parents need show and teach their kids that the attitude is the key of life, that they need have a good attitude if they want to be a good person in the future, that they want to be a professional, and be better person everyday, they will think on that, they will ask themselves why their parents try teach them that the attitude is important, and they will tray to have a good attitude for be a successul person.

In conclusion, the attitude is the key that will open all the doors you want, thats no matter what problems you have, when you do something you need doing with the best of you attitude, all is going to be perfect when you got a good attitute with people and with yourself. Try and see how your life is going for a straight way. They will enjoy their life, be happy with themselves and with the people around them, is all about how you acting, how you express yourself, and the way you talking with people, every person need make a different and show to everyone that the attitude is important to life, they will learn if the see that most of the people is doing it, try to make a different and see how everythinh is change for you. All is based on you.",human
"Failure the Success of Life

Winston Churchill was a British Minister.

He was a writer famous for his phrase that he ussually used.

Once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

I belive, that failure is an important element that plays in the persuit of success, because the failure lead to succes, failure is unavoidable, learn from your mistakes, and the failures often leads to problems.

One reason is the success that consist of going from failure to failre without loss the enthusiasm.

Failure is unavaidable, the path of success is not a straight on.

Every people have to fails sometimes in the life, but that is part of the life.

For example sometimes, invest money in some bussiness, but we don't know if go to win a lot money, or lost all the money or just one part of money.

If for some reason we fails, doesn't matter, we need to try again, maybe that would be the success to have your company owner. Never say not, before try it.

Another reason, is to learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistakes at least you know, not to do it again.

A failure might put end thing idea or opportunity, but lead you others.

If you ready failure and you know what was the mistakes try to find a solution, and not come back with the same ideas, you need to learn for each mistakes.

For example, if I say something wrong, like English word, if somebody heard me and corrigir me, I try to not say that word again.

One more reason, failure often leads to problem, we need to solve our problems and getting throught difficul times makes you smarter and stronger as a person.

By dealing with your failures you will to be prepared and have most experienced in the future.

If you know that to fails before, so you are somebody with most experience in the life, you know that if you have a important roll in your work, that is why you to fails in some time, but you need always to continue ahead.

Everyone have differents kind of problems, but each problem have solution.

If for find solution is possible that we go to fails, just doing that, we need to solve each problem without doesn't matter what come ahead we always want the success.

In conclusion, failure can change who you are, and what path you're on the life.

To fails in our life is something that cannot to avoid, but we not wanted to be a failure always, we want to change and have success. Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success. We need to pass for differents path and in each one, we go to learn new things.

Mistakes only makes smartes, and working to solve problem only makes us strongen.",human
"Dear Principle i have herd that you are deciding whether all students should perform in the community service. I think it will be a great idea for our school and for our community. This will be able to help people know that if we do are work together as a group we will accomplish more work and that not just one man can do everything but if we are united we will succeeds. By doing all of this it will be able to make are town cleaner and let people know that we care about this town. By the way this will be a great opportunity for our community to be clean so if different people who comes from different places will make good judgement about are community and maybe they might tell their friends how they think about it.

"High school is like a preschool for young adults, where they get a chance to explore the world much earlier.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future. Agreeing something that everybody has done, is something that people can agree on.     ",human
"This is a very good prompt to write about but i might have to agree on this becuase if you keep failing in life and sometimes you get bored of it you might have to change your mind and be success. Bacuse fialling in life is not that easy for same people. But sometimes people might disagrer it becuase if you fail you can't be successful in life, and if you are trying to get a job and you keep failing on what the boss is asking you to do you might not get the job. Even thought in school you can't keep failing.

I also agree with Churchill's satement becuase you can't just success in life without trying becuase life is evry hard to success in it. and if you wants to be success you really have to try in life, there's so many people in life that don't have job,place to sleep or food to eat becuase they did not success in life. Success also consists of going from failure to failure becuase sometimes in life you have to fail, no one in life have success from the day they were born.

My comclusion is that failure can leasd you to success.    ",human
"Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",human
"I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.

if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. It well be hard, but not impossible. First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.

I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.

In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. ",human
"I agree with Mr Ralph waldo that To be Yourself in a world full of fake people is a great accomplish,No matter what you do for other people they will always treat you like a piece of garbage,So What's The point of Pretending to be someone that's not me.

I Prefer to be Myself and be happy Then, Pretend to be someone else just to make people like me,

people will like me for the way i am and not for who I'm Pretending to be so that I dont have to waste my time hanging out with fake friends.

I know people that are a shame of where they came from and they started forgetting their culture and start adopting a new one. every time someone ask them about their past they just look a way and try not to answer because they dont one the rest of the people to know how they use to live and now that they have everything they wanted they act like they were never there.

theres people that pretend to have lots of cars,money and houses just to look superior than others that just messed up i dont see the point of making others feel bad just to make you feel superior thats just stupid why do you pretend to be someone that you are not even close to?

thats messed up i seen this happen a lot of times in my life and it makes me feel sad.

That is all have to said i hope that one Day this society will change their point of view and accept all the mistakes they had done.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",human
"The limitation of human contact has been a negative effect in peoples lives; people are so caught up in today's technology that no one really talks in person anymore. People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

Most people feel like technology has a good effects when it mostly doesn't. Technology is mostly a bad thing because people decide to date each other through text rather than in person and people communicate mostly through text. People need to go out into the world and talk to new people. Everyone needs to see the difference in the real world rather than through text.",human

All the schools are planning to do one in their community because the state weather its not so good in the communities, because of the contamination of the fabrics and cars, its better for the students and teachers to do a community service because that way we can have a better life without contamination and another way that helps is that we can have a better health.

"Do you think that the first impression can change my statement?

some people change the statement with the impressions for to made best result or to have a bets answer, therefore not all people can make this possible,

but while the people always try the bets.

i'm disagree because, based on my experience some time i said my first impression, and its hard to change, but is not impossible all is possible if you try the best, my mom said that you always have to change the first impression if is not correct.

My mom said that you always have to change the first impression, because you will be more secure of what you doing, and your life will be more better, and safe, I remember that she always toll me becarefool of what you choice, because that what you do in the present will affect your future.

Some time you have to think of what you choice, and i choice that i'am disagree, because i said if you think two time your impression your impression will be better if you said a best impression, so you have to think what you said because if is not correct you will have a big problem.

Should the people said the first impression, but if you see that you first impression is not correct you have to change the first impression, and make a better impression, because two is better than one. ",human
"I agree with the writing ""

Determine never to be idle

"" buy Thomas Jefferson. I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something. the second reason that I agree is that I think we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen.

Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up.

Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self.

In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well.    ",human
"Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a groups is more beneficial because of the extra help you'll have. You wont have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from.

Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice.

Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because you'll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another.

Projects of all kinds have to look good. Lets say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class.

Group working is so much better for everyone because you'll learn teamwork, learn that you'll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect. The more people in your group, the more help, care, and ideas you'll have for your project. You'll learn something new from all of this and others will to. This is why I think working in groups is more beneficial for schools and jobs. ",human
"Adopted a four-day work week with each conisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this modle.

From my opion yes. Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. Like for example If my school have adopted a four day school week with each day two hours. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself.

"Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice

I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.

Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.

Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.",human
"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the persuit of success .The Success consists of going to faillure to faillure without loss of enthusiasm. Next the success consists in many things. For example the Prime Minester Wiston Churchill said that, because he always persuade . That the enthusiasm is it the most important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word.

First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can reading the message. So if who read the prompt may perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the futere business can thinking about it. Then if they don't have any enthusiasm they won't have success in a not very far away future. Finally that is what I think about the prompt said Churchill's statement very important role that failure plays in the success.

First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That means you will have the same situation going to failure in your live. Then finally never loss the enthusiasm that is the point for all success.

For the success if you are unwilling have a little enthusiasm. So, as you are trying to do and you fail. It's only one reason that was not enough enthusiasm to doing it. You have to preform and trustly in yourself.

Also I think that success is for who are looking and persist with enthusiasm. Finally that is the enthusiasm consists in the future.

The important role from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I am agree with that statement said, you never think you cannot do anything. Also I think if you feel without enthusiam you always will failure. So if you purpose is the success you should hard work and don't feel you cannot. Then if you willing you won't failure. Finally I think just sometimes that if believe in yourself you may do anything including if you came from failure to success.     ",human
"People who value self-reliance are people that can make their own decisions. They know what to do when it comes to the important matters in life. They aren't dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they don't listen to other people and don't make their decisions based on what other people say.

Self-Reliant people know how to get through their important or ""life changing"" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that don't make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run.

Self-Reliant people aren't dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions you've made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life.

Making your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision you've made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision,

while others just think about what they should do themselves. People should just follow their instincts, their gut feeling of what they want to do; they shouldn't listen to other peoples opinions. The people should always try to make their own decisions instead of always relying on the guidance of experts and authorities.",human
"To who may concern.

The Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is well know that some people believe in this statement and some other don't. There are some reasons to believe this is true: one, failure gives experience to do it better next time, two, failure makes one think about different possibilities to be prepare to control the situation, three, failure gives the option to try again.

First, failure gives experience; this helps to learn how to dont make the same mistake. For example, to learn how to cook is a ""try and fail"" because one needs to put a specific amount of spices and vegetables is a long process to give the food a good flavor; failure said what are the mistakes one needs to correct like to dont put much sugar in the cake or dont put much salt in the salad. Another example, learn a new language is difficult in various forms like the pronunciation or the form to make a sentence; failure give experience to improve abilities like these too.

Second, failure makes one think about different possibilities. For example, if one try to built a ship inside a bottle and fail because the little pieces of the ship broke inside for dont be careful, that persons if going to think about what can make the pieces break next time to avoid the same situation. Another example, if one flew a kite and a bird or the wind make the kite crash, the next occasion ""what can make the kite crash?"" is going to be a possibility to think.

Third, failure gives the option to try again. For example, take a test driver and fail but still studying to take it again; to get the necessary score to pass, this show that person decide to try again. Another example, when one try to learn how to do a magic trick, the first times fail is guarantee, but with perseverance one can be the best magician, this can be only reached if one decide to try again after fail.

Although, one can learn from the failures, is not necessary fail to success, but sometimes one can't decide to don't fail; fail is a form to learn something from the mistakes, for example, fail to do something can make one know what is wrong and what is necessary to do to correct and prevent a future failure.

In conclusion, one dont need to fail to learn, but ""perseverance is the key for success"" and when one go from failure to failure without giving up; the action to dont give up show how capable is that person to success.",human

He is always happy and smiling he shows wisdom and makes other around him happy. My other person the shares wisdom and experience is my grandma.

She has share a lot of her experience of cooking I learn something new from her cooking ability she is a bit old but it does't stop her she has a lot of energy to make food for her family I learn from by seeing her cook an egg or make chicken I see her, and learn from her experience.

When we go to the beach my grandma always takes food so she wakes up early and starts cooking.

From the experience from my grandma I learn how to use spices and cuts of meats in a dish,

Also learn the amount of vegetables or spices that some dishes have my grandma been cooking for almost all her life she knows what taste good and what taste bad.

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates.

I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

Thats why I listed to what the older grandpas and grandmas have to say when I do something Bad or incorrect because they pass that and know how it was and they want us to Be susses full in our on life and they share with us wisdom and experience and thats Important because they we can learn from them.",human
"In my oppinon school is good how it is now. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break. ",human
"The resources is very limited in our world. How to economize resources? It become a topic. Some businesses have four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. This way may economize resources so school can use this pattern also.

But for this idea people have different opinion. Someone say school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because only four-day school students can not learned enough knowledge. But in my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources and four-day school may promote students efficient study.

Some parents think four-day school is too sort for them children can not learned enough knowledge. And three-day weekend is too long. them children may do not study. So parents worry about the foreground for them children.

In my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources. We can do a easy math for this question. How many electric for one lamp? How many lamp in one school? How many school in US? You can image it is a big resources spend just for electric. That is why I am agreed the four-day school.

The four-day school have benefit to student also. Because students need learn five-day knowledge in four-day. It may promote students efficient study. The efficient study is useful for the study and work at future.

The resources is valuable for us. We mast economize them. So, I recomment should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. ",human
"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",human
"We accomplish more when we are active, and are always doing something. I want to go to a university, but to achieve this goal, I have to put forth effort my going to school and studying all the time. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.

In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better.

My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmother's house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life. She gets angry when I try to stay in bed and not do anything, because I always need to be active to get somewhere in life.

My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother.

"My first opinion,

would be that to be a good person,

is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen . For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence .

My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the they love them.

After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision . So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you.

In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also if you are a good students,you will be have credit for college but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because the would make you a good behavior.",human
"'If the school adds one hour and thirty minutes in a schools day'' honestly i dont agree nor disagree their some pros and con with this topic. The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they don't let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day.

The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school.

In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired. So having more time in school is good and bad .    ",human
"People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities.

People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength.

Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. Also when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people. Therefore i suggest that people, especially kids, to go outdoors more.",human
"Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said,"" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I will explain the meaning behind this. And if i agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first.

The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modevant you.

I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn bad

As long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may of had the same problem.

Duke Ellington was a great jazz ,but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very modevation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.                                    ",human
"Do you make your own decisions or do you seek guidance from experts ? I believe that people should be able make their own decisions. I believe this because people are not away right about things and what they say. Another reason would be because only yourself know what chooses you want to make in life and so those are your decisions. My third reasons why I would say that people should be able to make their own decisions is because you shouldnt follow what others do. You always see people making good or bad chooses or making not good decisions but does that mean you got to do what others do, no because you have to make those chooses on your own.

My decision for people to make their own decisions would be because trusting others on what they say isnt always the right things. Would you want your best friend making a decisions for you ? Maybe not because you never know if she/he could be right or telling a lie. People in life are not always right about things ,you dont want to get in trouble for doing something dumb or that isn't the right thing for you to do . If you make a good decision on something at school or basically anywhere you can show others on how to make good chooses so they wouldn't make mistakes . This why you shouldn't listen to people making decisions for you this is because they can cause problem and get you in a situation where you dont want to be put in.

In life theirs so many things you can do but it all up to you . You decide what you want to do, you shouldn't let other people judge you in your decisions because they shouldnt get in involved . This is because everyone does what they want to do in life . If you make a bad decision thats all on you because you made the decision not someone else you can't blame others for that when it comes to you getting involved in a situation that you got yourself put in. I know your children in school might've gotten in trouble with something and if not it because they are great children who don't follow what others do. There are ton of students in school who make bad decisions and this because they like to do what others do by following what others do and seeing others do bad chooses. In that case that is not right because it makes them get in trouble and they lose time of education for making bad decision.

When it comes to making your decisions you make your chooses. Only you know what chooses you want to make. If you do don't want to do something you should't do it . Don't be afraid to not do something because you think it a bad decisions just first before everything think about what your doing. You should always question yourself is it a good choose or not because your the one making your own chooses. Everyone is their self you shouldn't be controlled by anyone. When it came to me making new friends at school I choose wisely with who I would want to be friends with because I didn't want me to be influenced by making bad chooses by others. No one has the right to choose to do things for others when it comes to making chooses it all depends on yourself.

In conclusion just always remember that you should always pick your decisions and not others for you. I know in the world we live in we all know that not everyone makes good chooses which is okay in some cases. This just means that not everyone is perfect which is true because their is at least one thing in life that you made a bad decision on. People just need time to think about what chooses or decisions they want to make so that after they make the chooses or decisions they don't think about it twice and why they should've made a wisely decision. Don't let yourself down or stress about what's rights for you in life.     ",human
"Imagine yourself getting out of high school early, and going to college or the workforce. It's really exciting because all that hard work was worth it, and you made it, but to get through you had to give up many of the activities you liked as well as your time. That is why it's not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students must take classes during the summer. Many students may not be able to take elective classes. Finishing early can be very stressful for students.

Students finishing high school in three years must take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Many students work over the summer, and having to take classes would not give them time to get a job. Instead, students would have to attend to school, do homework, study for tests, and quizzes. Similarly, if students take classes in the evenings, and want to be enrolled in sports, or clubs, which require students to stay after school. They would not be able to participate.

If students finish high school early, they may not be able to take elective classes. In order for students to graduate, they have to take required classes. This required classes are also important when getting into a college. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography.

Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, it's a good idea. However, it can be very stressful for students. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they won't get behind. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations. All of these can stress students a lot, and won't have time for their own.

It's not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Students would not be able to take elective classes. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students. Schools should not offer students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early.",human
"Farmer British prime minister Winston Churchill once said that ''Success consists of going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with Churchill's Statement because some time in life u fail but never gave up in life. keep fighting and you will get to the place you want to get. Work hard if u fail and fail never say i'm done trying the same thing over and over. Because one day u will not know what will happen if u keep trying.

Firstly,Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss some time people feel safe without loss in their life. For explane you trying to became a prime minster in the future and people telling you. Can't became a prime minister but all you get to do is work heard in life true in yourself you can do anything you put you mind to in life.

Secondly. some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Some people think that failure to failure is good because some time people like to try one think over and over on tell they do good at it so that what some people think in life to gave when the chances to do the same thing over and over even if they could't do it they just when to keep trying.

Sometime people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss. Because they dont like to keep trying one thing over and over so they feel safe without loss in their life. But other think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Because people like to try the same thing over and over on tell they do good at it.

Conclusion, sometime is good that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In everything you do in life. But sometime is good that ''success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm.'' in life...          ",human
"why is better to have summer break than have it in different time of the year? Some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall,and some people argue that should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 weeks break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I disagree that students should have a year-round schools because students will not learn if they have many breaks during the year, students would not have enough time with their families, and friends, also students would have hard time to do their work.

First, Students will not learn if they have many breaks. I think that is better if students have summer break than have it in different sections of the year. for example; if students want to travel to other state for vacations they would have to travel a week before so they can have fun, but students have to come back a week before school start, and they will forget what have they been learning the pass months. the main point of this example is that there is no point of doing a year-round schools, because that would affect students.

second, students would not have enough time with their family, and friends. Students travel every summer to other states to visit their families, and friends. for example; Most of the students travel every summer to other states or countries, but if students have year-round schools they will not have enough time to have fun with their families, and friends, also they would make less plans, because students would have to come back a week before the school start. from this example the main point is that students should have their vacations in the summer, and not in different sections of the year because they take time to those students, and when they go back to school they will not make any effort to do what they suppose to do.

third, students would have hard time to do their work. they would not have enough time to complete their worksheets from school, because they were having fun with their families, and friends in other countries. for example; if most of the students travel to different countries or states, and when they come back home students will be tired, and lazy to do their work, but if they have summer vacations they will be exited to go to school, retain information as easily when they come back. from this example the main point is that students should have summer vacations so they can be exited when they come back to school, and be great during the school.

finally, students would be more time in the school learning more, and paying attention to the teachers, also they will get their work done more faster, and students would be more positive to pass their SOL'S. Although students would be more successful in school.        ",human
"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need.

To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.

Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and she's a junior. When we don't have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; she's not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior.

Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when they're in college.

To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything. High school, its one of the best step of your life, where after you graduated from there, you would like to come back and stay more than four years.",human
"First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. and also it can affect your reputation.                   ",human
"With the development of education, every school always have classes to support student's natural abilities and students, who love arts, are also free to enroll and find out their strength. Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. It's a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who won't spend time to practice it.

Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they can't locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose.

Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it.

We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes won't be electives to select student's natural abilities; a huge students, who aren't serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time.

To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they don't waste time in the block they even aren't interested in.

"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses.

Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.

Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked

4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.

Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.

There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.

In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .               ",human

This visit will help me understand how the people are too.

Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on. Also at a company while they are working help people see how things are here and if they like it or not. Letting people see your work space will let them know what kind of company this is.

Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help chosing colleges and schools. Instead of wasting time looking all the colleges looking here could help narrow the options a bit. Knowing what course to take will help me pick what college I want and will help me narrow the list instead of looking all over the place.

""" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and that's very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference.

In Thomas Jefferson's quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. I feel like some people don't do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe that's not the case in some situations.

There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. I feel like that's very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that don't do anything and they have nothing good going for them.

I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change.

My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and that's all that matters. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well.                  ",human
"My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with my principal because you cant force anyone, they can do whatever they want, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity.

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions. Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that.

Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something.

I disagree what is the principal is saying because they cant forcing any the student, the students should decided they own, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity. The students should be able to choose what they ever want.     ",human
"Imagine walking outside with your dog and someone comes up to and treats you like a criminal like he just killed a person, stole money, and bombed a house! Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. People in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other.

In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings. People have been effected by other for not being treated correctly.

Treating others with rudeness is not going to effect you or kill you, it is the opposite it will help you become a different and better person than you were before. Treating others with kindness can make peoples day wonderful. Some people might have a bad day and if you help them and treat them with kindness, they will feel a lot more better. Being nice to people will make your life a lot more easier and you will feel like you have accomplished something big.

I strongly believe that people should start being nice to others even if they are not respecting you. Being nice and respectful to others is what everyone wants you to be, but if you do the opposite than your life is going to become harder. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, and that includes being nice, helpful, and kind to everyone.",human

Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of succes because if we fail we learn how to stand up after every time we fall down,For thing we never had we have to do something we never did,If we fail big we learn big things,and we fail once we have to try again.

In life stuation we fail but it does not mean we never pass,Life is hard to deal with it but we can deal with it,every time we fail we have opportunity to fix it,Life is about gulliblety bad ideas come to our mind but we don't have to think about it we have to think positive,Every time we fail we think we are guilty,We think we are useless,We think we can not do it but there is somwthing in the back we have to catch it that thing is success.

We are skillful that thing is notthing against our skills,we always worried about what others think what we accomplish and what we carry out but it is our job that what we do, We have to lead our self to get success and we are the finder,there is alot of ways to pass we can get help from others:family,teachers,friends,and people;every body is liable for there own work.

Once i had biology class that i had to pass SOL I toke the SOL fourtimes at the last time i pass it,It was hard to pass SOL for me but i never stop accomplish even i hate that,In some point in our life we fail but we do not have to loss our firmness or solidity,We do not have to shrik responsibility,We have to strenghen our ideas,We ahve hopes in our life that we need to make them true,In some points in life we have to calm down take a teep breathe and focuse on our work, In a test when we fail we learn things like:what was in the test,how to use an other strategy to pass the test,how to try,and what can we use in the test like dictionary;This is how failure play in the pursuit of success.

People can have skill or talent they might not even know they have one. Skill can be anything like being good at math when other people are are not, you might not be good at English but other people are. it does not matter if your not good at something. like you can be good at soccer but be bad at baseball. skill can come in different ways.

like mine. My skill is talking to people. I don't know why I like to talk to other people but i just do. But It can get me in trouble like. When Im doing a test I like to turn around and talk to my friends and i always get in trouble for this. or when Im in class I like to talk to much with my friends and not do my work and sometimes I talk to the teacher for a long time and not do my work. Talking to other people can be a good thing you like not being shy. I used to be shy but i start talking to people and became not being as shy as I used. There are more ways that talking can be good for like building a good friendship with other people like least year. I started talking to other people this year and made a lot of new friends. And you can become best friends with the teacher it a good thing to have a good friendship with the teacher. Talking can help you with making new friends out of school. like at birthday party you can talk to people you don't even know. talking is a good skill to have because. it can help you with the real world. Like when you see some one have a bad day you come and talk to them and make them feel better then they were. my skill can be good or bad at sometime. but that my skill. ",human
"I think we choose our character traits and we are influenced beyond our control. I say both because sometimes we choose to be who we are without nobody telling us what to do, what to say and not forcing us to do something we don't want to do. Choosing our character traits can be something hard for some people, because some of us think that we are going to be judged by other people and some of us think that we are not going to get accepted for who we are. Me I do both sometimes I choose my character traits and sometimes i'm influenced by other people, I don't think its good to be influenced by other people because I think we should be the one's controlling our character traits at all times. But sometimes we feel forced to do something we don't wanna do or say and it's not part of our character, But we feel we have to because there maybe someone watching or it could just be pure pressure, Doing stuff we don't always do that is basically getting influenced by other people because we are doing something that we don't really want to do. This is why I say it's both we choose and we are influence.

I think you don't really choose if you control your traits or not, because some days you can be yourself and other days your kinda getting controlled, because you do what people are telling you what to do and basically your not yourself your not doing what you want to do your listing to other people. I really think theres no option I think everyone does both, one day they are themselves and some days they are not themselves because there not doing what they want to do, there kinda getting controlled in some type of way.

In conclusion I think every one does both they choose or sometimes they don't, Honestly I think everyone should be themselves and not let anyone control them. Everybody in this world should choose there own character traits but it doesnt happen because we all sometimes feel that we get influenced by some other people, Basically what i'm trying to say is be yourself and don't be someone your not.

"Though most people think the inactivity serve a purpose however, the people always need to doing things in their lives. All the people need to have something to do in their life. Most people in the world think an inactivity person can have in effect to other people, so the people need to always do something in their life. The people need to have more activity in their life. A activity person can have many success things can change their life and the future a new generation in their families. A person with more activity can be more successful .The inactivity is a person lazy can do not care about doing something their life so, they may be do not care about other people too.

Many people in the world does not have a job , but they do not look for it. The people feels lazy to move around looking for work and they only waste their time doing nothing. The people pass their time without a work so, they are not doing nothing for their future for that many people in the world are very poor. They can have a good future if they do not waste their times doing nothing. In many countries there are people who are very lazy for work, so they going to streets to ask other people give money to them. The people have many opportunities in their life but , they do not think about it. An inactivity person do not care about if they can have a job or not. That kind of people just think have a free times. To be a lazy person do not have any purpose in the life.

"NO MORE LIMITTING!

Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. But should students be forcibly required to take a music,a drama, or an art class?

Students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives.

Dont limit they're choice

If school start to limiting classes and require to take certain classes, this is truly ineffective for everyone.

All students have rights to pick what they're interested in, and what they need. For example, If they're applying colleges and they need some specific classes and credits ,they might want to take what they're needed other than art and music class because its simply waste of time.

It's unpopular, unnecessary, and unprofitable for some students.

Not every students are artistic person and want to take a music or art class. Maybe art or music is not they're area ,according to newspaper ""CNN"" 's participation experiment graph, it compared to people who are interested and those who are not, and graph showed people who are not interested seems to loosing they're focus and even irritating them.

It's waste of time if they're not into it, they will eventually end up loosing interest.

There is no point of waste our precious time by doing things that we are not into it, obviously it's always privilege to take academic classes in school ,but it's not always the case. we rather do something else that are more fun and more productive for us.

It is mortal for some students especially seniors.

If school is limiting and make require to take academic classes it is mortal for some students especially seniors, those who failed one or two classes and need to make up. But because of school is limiting and make require to take academic class they couldnt graduate on time.

I strongly believe that students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives. If school make art and music and other academic classes as a elective, it will be more effective for everyone, because every students will have choice to pick what they really want or need. Even for teachers as well, teachers will be teaching students who really want to learn. it will be beneficial for both of them.",human
"Some students don't have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.

One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.

Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. For example, I have 3 careers I'm thinking about but can not choose one. I have 1 year to think about which one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. i want people to see it not hear.

Some students already know what career they want to take. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. This can help the students in many ways. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.

For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. They can take a break and think very well about their options. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them.",human
"I agree with him because, we all have a specific dream or mission we want to accomplish and every dream or mission have a standard end point on less you expecting something far more better than what you are having or where you are at that particular time or moment.

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

But then I got to realize I have to wait for the right time to come else people will take advantage of me. If I had never mastered it wouldn't have any experienced and would have never grow because I thought it was easy.

Life haven't be easy after loosing my dad some years ago,used to have a lot of plans in the nearest future with my dad. Was planning on graduating and buying a big house for us when I find myself a good job, but since I lost him everything just shattered and i don't know what to do. Am now living with my mom and step dad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work,I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad ,it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself.

"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this statement, a couple of reasons why i agree with this statement. The journy, learning new things, and the final results of what you have mastered.

First reason will be the journy. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody.

As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow."" You have to still keep on mastering new things in order for you to grow more. Those are my three reasons why i agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. ",human

"In this essay I will talk about how courses and daily life in high school influence the students to guide them and to think in a specific career. When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age.

The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support.

The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society.

Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild.

Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. That's why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone.

In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported. The most important area is focus in their future as the best, doing big differences and doing a legacy. To be young is awesome.",human
"Have you thought about your first impression of someone and did it change or not? because our first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at a new school and when you go to an interview for job.

First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed.

Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that don't have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didn't actually wanted to work and that I wouldn't take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I won't get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job.

In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right. So don't judge a book by it's cover!",human
"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.

Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in today's era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.

Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination.

Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals.

In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.    ",human

"According to Emerson's statement and what he wrote, which is about to be myself in a world would make me something else and it will be the greatest accomplishment. I am totally agree with his statement because there are many thing I can do well. Also, I can show to the world that being myself would make me see that I can do more than I think, I can develop many good idea about life and how to build my future making good choices, which ones will make me feel good about what I am accomplishment.

One reason why I am agree with this statement is because being myself make me feel confident about what I am doing and how I can make it better. For example, I like the way I am and being happy, I like to be a person with positive thoughts. I like to demonstrate people that I can do good and make them feel proud of me of all the thing I can accomplish by my own. It will make me get really good experiences in life which will help me to be an unique person and honest with myself.

Second reason why I am agree with Emerson's statement is because when I be myself I feel comfortable with me, I can demonstrate that being myself I can make good choices to be a better in the world, I can show many things which I would feel proud of. For example, I like to be myself when I have to present any project at school or at my job, I feel good to be myself and that way I explain it, I am confident with what I am presenting. It makes me feel honest to myself and everyone else.

Another reason why I am agree with this statement is because being myself I can develop many good ideas and I can share those ideas with everyone, I can do a good job and accomplish all what I want. For example, when I talk with somebody, I like to speak with the trust and share what I think. I like to do my job being myself because that way I would see how I am doing and what do I have to do better.

In conclusion, being myself is a good way to see what I am good in and how I can get experiences in many different thing, I can learn more about the world and learn more about me. It would make me see the world in a different way which one will help me to do the right things and also it would make be a strong person in this world.",human
"Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Students needs time with friends and family. ",human
"My grandmother always says ''If you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different ways to get in the top of your objective.'' Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. I am agree with this statement. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people don't trust themself, people don't take second chance, doesn't matter the time.

To begin with, most of people do not trust themself. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. You most have to trust in yourself. For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. But one day my grandma talked to him. My grandma told him that he has to try even though things are hard, if he want to accomplish his goals he had to try to make something else to achieve his goals.

Secondly, there are people that don't take second chance to get on top of their goals. The 60% of people when they have something done, they don't like the result so they don't want to do it again because they did ones so they don't want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasn't that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong. Hence, it wasn't like that,so what I trying to say is that is essential to try, try, and try, ''My mom always says don't be scared to do it, the thing that are worth it isn't eassy you have to try and give your best.''

In addition, many people said you must have to try something else it doesn't matter the time. There are people that does't care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. For example, my best friend Generic_Name always says don't worry about the time you have to get what you want, you have to accomplish the things that you porpuse yourself take the advantage of the time.

To sum up, as you can see if you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different things. Just try keep in youjr mind that the ones who work in what they want they to achieve. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but that's not the point. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals. I think people don't believe in themself, don't try twice, and people don't think about the time.",human
"Imagine going to a school that has a longer student release time then any other school, imagine feeling tiered and restless everyday you come home from school, well the school board is about to make that ""dream"" happen for this school.

The school days should not be extended because most of the students will not have a plesent time spending more hours in school, for example most students at the end of the school day feel tiered and they just want to go home and sleep, if an extra hour gets added to the school day most of the students will be angry and agitated.

A second reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because it will be confusing for parents, it will be confusing for parents because most parents have a specific time that they pick up their kids and when the time changes for the students release, parents will get confused and it will be a disaster.

A finial reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because after school courses will be longer, this will be a issue for after school buses because they will have to change their whole schedule for picking up students in the afternoon.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to have an extra hour added to their school days, and the school board should keep everything the same. ",human
"To to successful you may have to archive it. You might encounter or even fail so many times, but who cares, as long you try and try you will be successful. So will you just give up if you failed? and of course, people will judge you because you're not perfect. That's why Winston Churchill once said ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement. In life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.

To begin with, a lot of people thinks failure will only make you look bad and some thinks its the end of the world for them but that's not the case. Every each person make mistakes and having a motivation in your self will get your somewhere: however, when a person is lack of motivation in their life, they won't be as much successful and failure will take over.

Secondly, when it comes to hard times, a lot of people say that there's no point of trying if you're meant to be a failure. Every each person in this world know that they're capable of, and every each person know what their weakness are. However, having encouragement won't mean anything because if you're encourage enough, you will get back up and do anything you can to be successful.

At last, learning from your mistakes is the key to be successful. You will fail and fall but its very important that you get up and keep fighting because once failure takes over, it will be hard to get back up. Also you will need to earn the key to success, but once you find it, you will achieve anything in life not because you didn't give up but because your learn from your failure and mistake.

In conclusion, people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement and in life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.                ",human
"No, I am disagree with Emerson's statement. Some people think that just because they manepulate you will change. If some elses want to make you different, or change you is because; They are not happy with theirselfs.

I think that if the people that are aroud you wants to chage you is becuase they love how you are and want to be like you ; That best thing that you can do is get away from the people and make new ones that are possive and help you to become a better person, human. The worse thing that you can do is change because of others.

People treated you bad becuase they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those commen, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that detely were hurting me my feels. In adition, Every day they would told me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because i was dressing so poorly. i was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, i never let them make my self esteem go down. I was so possitive also my family give me good vibes too, They would told me you know were you wanna get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to.

Inconclution, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future i see that nobody is going to judge you.     ",human

"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things. The Government will can make that my dream came be true to have only 4 days of school.",human
"Why i agree with the school board planning to add one and a half hours to school is because it would give us more time to learn in each of our classes and it would benefit everyone.

my reason for why i agree with the school boards planning to add one hour and a half is because if we are doing a worksheet or any notes and we dont finish the notes because of how less of a time we have in the class and with that that extra hour we can get some more time to finish work we need to finish.

Another reason why i think that would be a really good idea is because it would not only give us more time to finish and do work but it would also be very helpful to the teachers. because it would give them more time to teach us and finish things they need to do. and Teachers won't have to worry about not finishing their lesson because of how much time they have in that class.

I also believe that if we do extend the school day longer we would learn more because of the extra time we are getting. and it would give us more time to learn. if we dont know how to do that subject the Teacher would have more time to go over it again and tell us step by step how to do it and help us to improve and get better at it.

Another good reason is because that extra hour can help us get better at the subject you dont like or can help you get better grades because the Teachers can show you how to do it and you won't struggle in test because the

Teacher reviewed it with you and it would benefit you because you would start getting better at it.

The extended hour can benefit the teachers a lot because it would give them more time for planning and doing stuff they need to do and what that extra hour we can make up all the work that we didn't finish.

The problem's if we do not get the extra hour is Teachers wont have time to get through their lesson because they wont have much time. and student's wont be able to get help on what they need help on. another reason is that students will fall behind because they won't have much time to get through the subject they need to finish and they will have to finish the next day while other people will be finished with that subject.

These are my reasons why i would agree on the school extending the school day one hour and a half longer because it would benefit the students and the Teachers.        ",human
"I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. However some students are not good at every but if they do what they really love it can learning fun for students. It can also impacted students to finish their goals and became better person in the future. Some student don have that kind of privilege as some students have to all subject so they can graduate from high school to go to college. That what make some students dropping out of high school, because they think they are not smart enough or some students cant afford to pay for some school supply.

I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First, it can make learning fun for students and they can enjoy what every career they what in future. Second, it can impacted students to go to school learn instead for skipping school making them falling their classes. Third, students should be expected to take a career that make them happy and want to do and they are also willing to do, also achieve their goals. example for students to like the idea of identify, is to prepare them college and some may not go to college and start working.

Inclusion students should chose a career the like and love. If they study the career they like their be less drop out of high school. They can also be success on what ever they can achieve in life. Also help them to a great future and everything is possible, however, I think that is a good idea for students to commit to a career a young age and to also help them became better person and make good chooses.

"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Concluding with paragraph one,two and three,'' working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,''. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,''that is gonna be your legacy,''. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.             ",human
"I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help those student who abuse eating at home.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",human

"Taking advantage of opportunities at a young age will significantly impact your future abilities of choosing your correct career path. Futhermore, when you're young, you have more time to research about the career that you are interested in. Most teenagers at a young age choose multiple careers of what is most interesting and cool looking to them. What's very important is that the particular person is willing to pursue in that career. At a younger age, most children get encouraged by their parents to love a specific subject. Nonetheless, depending on the subject that a teenager likes, that'll most likely be the career they pursue. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. When you're at a young age, you tend to gather information quickly, and also learn quicker.

Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. It's always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, it's always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well.

Teens at a young age tend to become more interested in careers more than adults. It's a fact that a teenagers brain consumes

5X

the information quicker then it would if an adult had. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires. It'll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it.

When there is a young aged teenager, it's best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and It'll be the introduction to their future career path. Teenagers play an important role in today's generation. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in.

High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. It's always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how she's doing overall.

The counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal.

When providing options to a young age teenager, it's best that you make it seem less work as possible. Teenagers most likely wouldn't like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. Nevertheless, it's an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future.",human
"Hook

Is it really true that Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

Conclusion

That was all my reasons why I disagree what Albert Einstein said. Knowledge is more important than Imagination, what can Imagination do to help you, Some people can start to Imagine and think that it will help them. those where my reasons why i disagree.",human
"Not everyone in the world is able to accomplish their dream. There are so many obstacles that make a dream impossible and a lot of important things to give up in order to reach it. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill because I also believe that failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life.

First, all the things have two sides. the bad side and the good one, not everyone can see this two sides because of two simple reason. The first reason is because they do not try hard enough to find a solution. The second reason is because they loss their hope. Failure has two side but they are hard to see. The bad side of failure is that you did not reach that goal in your first or second try and you give up everything. The good side is that you fail but you learn a little bit on the way and that the next time you will be more close to reach that lovely goal.

Second, some things that i have learn from family, friends, and own experiences is that hope is the most powerful thing in the world. Most people tempt to lose their hope when they fail, while for others that maintain it can be more able to success. When I try something and I fail I always ask a question to my self. The question is What would I be without hope? When i answer that question I feel that all my strength and enthusiasm that I need for reaching that dream come to me.

Lastly,

a person can not reach a goal without been enthusiast. No one in the world would fight for something that is not interested on. Enthusiasm is what give you the strength and hope to keep trying until you success. Enthusiasm can also be lose by a person when they fail so many times. The thing that make people lose their enthusiasm is the time.

In conclusion, in order to be a successful person in life you need to make sure not to lose the three keys. Failure, that help you to gain experience, hope that help you to not give up, and enthusiasm that help you to keep trying. This are the three keys. Next time that you fail just thing about this three keys and you will be able to success in your life.",human
"A career at a young age?

In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter to high school, but the big question here is: Do you think is a good idea for students to commit to a career to a young age?

To commit to a career at a young age is a good idea for students, who are interested to study a long career, for example: Doctors, pediatric, layer, teachers, etc. If students start to study this careers at a young age, they will be a great future for this country.

Also if students start to study at young age they will have more opportunities to continue with their careers, for example; if a teaher wants to start a new career, they can do it because he is young and has the capcity to continue.

To start a career at young age also has some desventages, here are some explamples why is not a good idea to start with their career at young age. Probably they will get tired of the school, they will to regret to study some career that years later reliace that they do not like.

In conclusion to commit to a career at young age is a exelent idea for the students, that is why, we have to motivate and support them with their careers, would be a good idea if teachears and consular, start to help them to find the corect career for their life.",human
"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",human
"In this competitive world people have to be a mastered in many things, but people are used to work in places that they are in comfort. Usually, people don't try to do something new that they are already do. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldo's statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same.

To begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing.

To add, People will not be able to grow, if they don't change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they can't play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same. People should explore beyond they are used to do in order to get growing. In many circumstances dare to do new things will gave people a benefit.

"I'm very interested in the nurse and now there's an opportunity that school tell us to strive for an internship in this hospital, i'm very glad to attend this competition. Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

"We have many parks that provide a wide of variety of interesting activities for everyone. There is many activities to enjoy ,But i will give you a specific activity that people would enjoy spending time outdoors. Why someone might find that activity enjoyable?, i will explain and give specific details.

As we all know that parks provide many activities for us. One enjoyable activity is playing soccer ,You don't need to have good skills to play soccer. Many teens play soccer or they are in a soccer team , because they enjoy it. I know there is a lot of enjoyable activities , but i chose soccer. I play soccer with my friends and family , we really find it enjoyable to go outdoors and have some fun together. Many kids don't like going outside because they think sports are boring , But they aren't boring to me. In the summer time parks are open for you to enjoy activities with your kids and family. You can choose to do any activity you think is enjoyable for your family. Soccer is a sport that can help you keep you healthy and have a good body shape. Your kids will enjoy playing soccer with their friends outdoors. Many parents don't let their kids go places with their friends , because they think something bad might happen to them.

Meanwhile , many kids like to play other sports that are different than soccer , but they still enjoy it. Soccer is the same as many sports kids do at school or at parks. Teens spend their time at parks playing many sports during the summer time. My family go to parks to enjoy the water and play games that they never played before. If i enjoy playing soccer i think you will too , why not have some fun and probably hurt ,but hope that doesn't happen to anyone. You feel free when you play a sport you like to play or you might want to try a new sport. Always try something new because there isn't a lot of time to enjoy moments like that.

Also,I think someone might find playing sports enjoyable , because it's fun playing outdoors with your family or friends. We have two seasons that we can play outdoors and you will enjoy it. Also parents will enjoy spending time with their kids. Why not take time out your day so you can spend time with your kids more. Yes , you might not like it but many people do like going outside to the park with their children. I think spending time with your kids will let them know that you care and love them.

In my conclusion one way you could have an enjoyable time outdoors is playing sports. why not go outdoors and have some fun with your friends. Enjoy the time you have with your family and friends , imagine if something happens that causes you to not go outdoors. You might not like going outside ,but do it for you and your own health. Outdoors can also help you get stress out and excise your body more. Enjoy the time you have to enjoy with your family. What activities do you like to spend time outdoors for ?",human

Some people change how the people they are. different people like to make new friend's by speaking to someone or everyone. Someone person are different form other person because people are not the someone form other. If someone don't speaking someone is not good to speaking someone form who you don't know. If you like to meet someone who you don't know speaking to the person, and before to to the person look at him or her, and be nice the him or her. if you think of something first think to speak the person make idea of your self.

I like to make friend all the time and i f make friend and his can be my friend too because he is my friend and to make is to be nice and good to everyone in main please.

Some people can change to not speak with no one because is not use self speak with someone you don't need to do. I think the best is to do anything or something. A positive in live is best to is you can have all of friends and negative you get a pet or just do it make friend.

When i go some please with my dog some don't speak with someone or i see a friend cell and with speak about anything and i go to the a store i speak with the workers to fun a tool for my house and i go to school i meet new people in my classes or out of class.

"I agree that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you will be exited for your next step and you want to know whats gonna happened once you have passed.

For example if you fail on doing something, you will be exited on doing it again until you haven't pass because you might be thinking thats your dream to achieve it or its really important to achieve what i fail in it. I heard story of a guy he fail a lot but he didn't gave up because he was still interested on the experiment, so he failed like 408 time I think and he passed at 409th times so you can imagine that he was still exited and interested on that experiment that he failed 408 times and he got success at 409 times.

So in life when people failed on something they move on because they might not be interested or exited on that thing that they have failed but many other people will keep trying until they haven't achieve it. they will keep trying because they love it or they are still exited on that work that they have failed.

I know some people don't like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you haven't achieve it because you can't be success in life without being a failure. when people failed on something they might say that its hard and i am not gonna do it again because they didn't try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it and it will be easier to achieve what you working on. So if you failed on something be enthusiasm on it it will help you more to be success in life.",human
"Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldn't make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our life's. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our life's, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts.

As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesn't makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldn't know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldn't have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isn't good for their goals in lifes.

However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our life's. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their life's. As a matter of fact,

when we are setting goals to our life's and we can't get that goal it's because we are doing something wrong and we don't even realize what's wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong.

In fact, sometimes it's hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people. Because the most mistakes we have and at the same time we overcome to have more experience in life. First of all, when we fix what we did wrong. Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success.

In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others don't think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because it's really important to me to be a determinate person. I think that those are my thoughts to be a better person in successful. and by the way, I'm totally agree that we have to fail first to be a success person.",human
"Should you start looking for career before you enter high school? Will it help you out and help you get a job that way, and is it important to set goals while your in high school and try to reach those goals in the future? All those question's are important to me because on my opinion those are ways to succeed in life. Those question's can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school club's for it.

Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if student's know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience. Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future.

For some people it isn't a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor.

If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goal's for yourself, and once you reach those goal's set harder ones to reach. You can set many type's of goal's like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goal's with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere.

If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday. One of my goal's is to own my first car before I graduate which is a Lexus Is300 2001. Setting goal's is important in life, and Ithink everyone should set some goal's for themselve's.",human
"The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. That's why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses.

This plan has two positions,some people agree, but others don't think it's a good idea. Is it a good idea? It is. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early if the students want because they can save time, they can have new experiences, new challenges which help for their life in the future, they still can take elective courses also have vacations latter after college or work if they want.

Let's start with the first reason now. Do you agree that the time is limit? The time is the only thing you can't move back. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. These programs will help many students save time. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. They choose have more time after success instead of have time when they haven't had anything.

The next reason will be the reason help students the most. Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more.

The last reason refers to elective courses. Many students like these courses, but some students don't. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they don't like or do not helpful for their career. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. They can choose also consider what is they need. Moreover, this plan don't require you skip these elective courses, you just may not be able to take these, so if you want to take courses, you can plan for this. It depends on your choice.

On the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. But if you think that it means you don't confide your ability also don't try for your future. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. You can choose your way, success will come soon or later depends on you.

Conclusion, we should support some schools offer these programs that allow high school students to graduate early if they can. Our life will change if we change, our success will come if we try, and it will happen early if we have a plan. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. However, it will be fair if students can choose take or not these programs.

The next day i went to popeye's restaurant with different type of clothes, and they didn't look at me in a strange way, and that was because i was dressing properly, and because my friend tell me to dress better because in the first time when i went to chipotle i was dressing as a bad guy and that make me look inapropiate and i did get the job.

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, ""hoo hellow you're back,"" then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

"When I think about wisdom I think about my grandpa he tell me story of how he lived back in his countries. He talk about how he grow up poor and barely had anything to eat or get though the day and how going to school was a big deal. He also told me how his brother and father died when he was six-eight, but he also told me how he came to America and how hard it was.

When my grandpa was born he was born poor. He had one brother a dad and a mom his dad did constructing and his mom most got everyone ready for school and tried to make everyone food. The closest school near my grandpa was 3.4miles away he had to go walking, but he went to anyway school he cared about his learning and he found it fun. It was a big deal to go to school where my grandpa lived or lived near by not many people get even get to go school at all it was that special.

My grandpa was only five when his father died his father was a man with a lot of problem. His father got him self into so much other people and gang. People looked for father but he kept low until one day he went to work and there were four people waiting for him he tried to run but he was to late because one of them shot him with gun they left him with three gun shot in his body laying on dirt he bleed out before the they could come and save him.

As for grandpa brother he got sick he said sick for two months my grandpa told me he was smart man he teach my grandpa how read and write better my grandpa said ""he the reason why he got such high grades in school"" when he got sick that when my grandpa tried to do everything for him so he can stay alive but back then medicine wasn't very good, and keep in mind we not in the u. s.a and it the year 1976 and if you did have that type of medicine it very expense. The most my grandpa and his mom can do is pray to god every night to get his blessing for his brother and his brother died in his sleep. They dug out a grave for him and everyone said there prayers his mother won't stop crying for one month but then she accept the fact he was dead.

When my grandpa got more older had two daughter and two son and he meant my grandma. He had to take the test to go to u. s.a. He told me it was hard because you had to learn a lot about u. s.a off of a notebook they give and out of that notebook they ask you 50 question out of the 200 question they could ask you, and it all random after he passed him he start to pack his back to America he said ""bye"" to my grandma his two daughter and two sons. When he was going to America he wanted to go to Virginia and he did he told me it was hard at first because he only know a little bit a of English he was looking for a job and he found one he worked at a restaurant and two other job once he start to make money he start to save it up to bring his daughters and sons and his wife he took him about 8 months he said to get all the money saved up.

"The benefits of having a good attitude

There are a lot of benefits because of having good attitudes, we can get more time to make again what we were doing and do not stop until we make it the best we could.

In other way, been with a good attitude can help us improve in life that helps us to learn, to concentrate and, to be a good thinking of someone else.

Also, something kind of the same happened to me some time ago when my father was teaching me how to drive, and every time I did something wrong he yelled at me and one day I was with a really bad attitude because of that and than I realized that been mad was not going to help me so i changed my attitude and i learn to drive really fast.

Been mad only makes us worst at doing that because we are not thinking about the positive thinks of that activity just at the negative thinks and thats what makes everything worst.

The benefits of having good attitude its that it can help us to try again something we miss, been frustrated only makes us waste our time and, also having that good attitude makes us improve a lot.",human
"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.            ",human

Introduction:

We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesn't have enthusiams they worry about to other people.

People who have enthusiams:

They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy.

They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

They can help to other person who need help.

They can to be the best in everything.

They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad.

People who doesn't have enthusiams:

If you doesn't have enthusiams, you can not do anything.

How you can help to other person if you doesn't have your own enthusiams.

If your enthusiams is bad, don't be alone.

If you don't have enthusiams, you doesn't wants to do anything.

Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

No, I'm not agree whith him because, if we failure and failure everytime again, so we enthusiams go to down, but if we failure just one time and the next time we are more preparate, is almost same that happen to me the day nobvemver 19, 2018,

that for see the hour from my phone, some people think that I did cheat in the SOL, but I doesn't need do that for pass this SOL.

Conclusion:

The bad enthusiams not just affect one person, that affect to the people who are in the around because if we can transmit cheerfulness to the other person and the other size the coin, other people can transmit the bad enthusiams I think so, so the person who have a good enthusiams they try to help to the other people. Winston Churchill with that he said, I understand that thing; That person whos failure and failure, are the person more strong because each failure they return more strongers and they do the best job.

"Do you think you give off right by having a negative attitude? Imagine being at the DMV everyone given you stares, and your family telling you ''you're not gonna pass"". As you sit taking the test ,all those comments replaying in your head. Can you see the difference? as if i was to be possitive, my attitude reflects off of what i give, and that is the key of success in life.

A positive vibe can make your days go faster. Everyone in this world has challeges, but i mean who doesn't? so with that being said we can overcome with putting effort and what you do or believe. The ability to have a positive attitude creates a mind set of trying new things, like driving, traveling, last but not least, education. Adjusting to a new enviroment helps alot with mental health.

My story starts with me going to the DMV. something i notice was, i was hearing negative comments about me not passing my test. My friends kept telling me that is was difficult and hard. Meanwhile at the time, it kept replaying in my head, and i reacted in a negative way.

One way we can avoid being gloomy is to stop hanging out with people who are bad influence, because if we do we give off the same energy. However if you will have potential on succeeding,and you well feel much better of your self.

Some people say that being negative is normal, but they are wrong because if you are always negative everyday that will not take you enywhere. It is always good to be positive, and if you are positive all things go well. In conclusion, is how we the people should change the way we see things, and move foward for better result. I hope that we can be more considerate on how we take things in life.                                  ",human
"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. That's what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.    ",human
"Students Need to Identify a Career

I am in 11th grade and I still thinking in what career should be better for me, if I could expected a career by the time I entered to High School, I could not being worry about what career should be better for me. I think that is a good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because in the four years that they are in high school they can get prepare in the career they want. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them.

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. For example, I had one friend that he wanted to be a scientist, so when he was in high school he get prepared to a scientist, he started to look what he need be a scientist, he looked how many years he had to go to college, he found that science has a lot of math problems that he did not know and he started to learn math. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. That's why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school.

In my opinion it's good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they don't get stress because they don't have much time to decide what career could be better for them.

"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape. I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.",human
"Certain

Occupations Through Internship and shadowing to discover

Many schools have partnership with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internship and shadowing opportunities to discover. Many schools look for the best for you to graduate and to have the best paying job, like I think it's a great idea that the school let's them go out to discover many things that we don't even know and things we never even knew that it excited at all. Students this days don't even know what they want.

I would and will do it of convincing my principle of school to let kids to explore bunch of things like I said before like trying to take them to field trips for them to learn how to use credit cards and take them out to explore nature and study countries.

The oppurtunities to discover will take him to the highest of knowing what he will really want in his future and college for a fact that many kids don't take lead for being scared. Taking the biggest step ever to learn the new life becoming adults. You should never listen to people taking because they will want one thing and another you should think of what you really are passion of working without any complain.

I would convince my manager to take me many places so I will be clear and happy about it. Lets say principle or manager to lets explore new things like better paying wage job like that you won't be killing yourself.

That would help of us thinking if we learn something we love it we can even make our own business and will make lots of money. that will be a fact why asking your principle for many things of going out to explore bunch of things, like that you won't be worrying about money, paying stuff, and won't be dealing with bosses because I hate that they pressure you so much. If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isn't much people to do that.

If your parents don't afford shouldn't be a problem if you have good grades you can earn scalerships to pay for them, You just worry about going out and finish high college of 4 years and enjoy it because you will definitely miss it after wards.  ",human
"I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for example

They can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolers

They can teach how to welcome people

It also helps them to have a great future

The Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobbies for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example

Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor

Help an old person cross the road

Teach kids how to write neatly

This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example

United Kingdom

Norway

Sweden

Denmark

Canada

And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families.

"Based on my experieneces, do I agree or disagree with Emerson's statement. I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.",human

"I strongly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. because your never going to succeed as a person in the work force or something else. because these people wont step out of their comfort zone. because they are too lazy or scared. Ralph has a very good point : Lazy, shy, scared people wont succeed or grow as a person or in the work force.

Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a at a big company.

Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you.

You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways.

Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isnt motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person wont succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond.

One time when i was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff.

The most important thing he told me is to do more than what i can already do. Because it will take me places and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When i got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew i was gonna do more in life. Now i work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because i work more than i already mastered.

I think working beyond than your comfort zone will help a lot. You can be really successful if you challenge yourself in life. It could be school or work. It doesnt hurt if you challenge your self. You will succeed as much than the other guy.         ",human
"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life.

Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard,

and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person.

Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world.

Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge.

Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them. Positive attitude is ambition for those who wants to live better and wants to reach their dreams.",human

"Is it true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time? Yes, because not everyone is a retard that wants to be studying and going to school all the time. Almost every student wants rest from homework. I think having a summer break for students is a good idea because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives them time to spend some time with their family and enjoy thier every minute of life.

First of all, I think it's a good idea to have summer break because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives students some free time to do what they want to do like trying new things out, playing new sports and finding what their real talents are, instead of doing school work and other activites all the time. Doing meditation is really good for your brain and mind, and it's only done when you have time for it and nothing to distract you.

Secondly, I think it's a good idea to have summer break for students because it gives them time to spend some time with their family. Some of us are really bad at giving our parents time in life because it's just too much to do everyday. Half of student's day they spend in school and get no extra time for their parents. Spending time with parents is not wasting time when your really enoying it and it's a good time spend.

On the other hand, some people might argue that it's not a good idea for students to have summer break because they will waste their time by being home all day or texting their friends. It will kill their education time and won't give them enought time to get to where they want to be in future.

In conclution, I think it's a good idea for students to have summer break because it gives them the opportunity to go new places they never been to and try out new dishes they never tasted. I think life is too short to be doing homework and studying for tests, and planning for your future. Life is about having some fun time and enjoying every little moment with your family and friends instead of focused on one thing all day and everyday which is school.    ",human
"Career commitment

Having a good career after graduation is every students success. Most student are wondering when is the perfect time to start thinking of what career they should focus on, so should student commit to a career at a young age, or students should wait after graduation to commit to their career?

Students may have a lot of chances to learn about different careers, and different field of studies while they are waiting to chose what career to focus on before graduation; however, it is a great idea for students to commit to their career at a early age.

It is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because student will know what type of courses are required for that particular career, students will not worried about what to do after graduation, and students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future career.

Initially, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will know what type of courses are required for that particular career. As a student looking for a successful career it is always a great idea to stay on top of your academic purposes. Knowing your purpose make is easy for you to elevate, and push yourself to achieve your goals, it will be really easy for a students to finished their courses because they already know what they need, so all they have to do is display some effort, and confident in them self. For instance, a student may wants to get a major on computer engineer. some of the requirement needed for that are: Math, Science, some wide knowledge on Computer software, and Computer Hardware. By knowing all these will be a great advantage for that student. That would a great reason why student should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them know the requirement needed for that particular career.

Secondly, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because student will not be worrying about what to do after graduation. As a student there is a lot going on in our personal life. Thinking everyday about what to do after graduation will be a stressful situation to be in. Knowing what to do before you graduate will not lead you to a stressful situation. An example, will be a student may have some family issues, and thinking of how to tackle those issues, so having to think about what to do after graduation without you knowing already will be really stressful. In that case I will say it is batter for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will not have to worry about what to do after graduation.

In addition, committing to a career at a young age is a great idea. because students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future job or career. To get started with a career you may need to know basic skills that will help on the way, and I think it is a huge advantage for student to start practicing some of these skills before going to the actual field of work ( career ). For instance, an Internship Program. Student may be attending an internship class,

to develop some skills. Student that attended a internship class may feel one hundred present confident to display what they have learn during their Internship class to the outside world. More Importantly this will help students to get started after graduation. Fundamentals skills are essential for any jobs or careers, so for any student that have the chance to learn some fundamentals skills of a particular job or a career would be a great head start for that student. That is why it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it will help students develop their some basic fundamentals skills needed for future career.

In conclusion, it is important for students to commit to a career at a young age because students will know what type of courses are required for that particular career, students will not be worrying about what to do after graduation, and students will be able to develop some basic fundamentals skills needed for their future career. For students to get a successful career students should always think ahead in terms of academic purpose. Knowing your purpose as a student is very important, and will always help students to be successful. As a final thought I would say knowing your major at a young age is very helpful, and it is an advantage for you as a student.                 ",human
"Of course the first impressions are almost impossible to change, when you meet with someone, you are waiting that this person can be nice to you, it depens on how you are as a person, sometimes people can make you think good or bad about them , that doesn't mean anything bacuse you dont know how somebody really is as a person until you start knowing about them or start talking with them by any way, you can get information about them from friends or someone who already know this person in case you really want to know about them. It is okay to look over the person you will meet because that way you are feeling sure with yourself about what this person can do or say about you.

Your personality is something that can define you as a human. If you want that people talk good about your personality when you meet them, you will have to give good impressions by doing things like saying hi when you arrive to some place, talk about the good things you have done, sports you play or any healthy activities you can achieve.

If you are a socialist person you know people will look at your personality when you meet them because they want to know if you are a pleasing person, the minds can change, imporessions never do, even if you know a person for a long period of time, you will never forgot how they was before you meet them for the simple fact that the first time is something that almost nobody can forget.

Another reason or example can be when you are looking for a job, you can give good impresions to your probably next boss and the people you will be working with, not just by how you acting it can be by how you are dressing too, your underwear many times can show much about you.",human
"Having school every single day is nobodies favorite free time to others it's there favorite hobby it also takes time and alot of studying to. There making everything so easy for us this year they will do 3 years of high school if I studying really hard to not stay for all 4 years by that addition they will be including to have courses during on summers or in evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. Which will be really helpful for me to have more hours to myself more of my free time I could studying way more to. More than I knew about these prgrams im glad I found about it because it can be a big change for me and everybody else. It's a 50 50 deal to me because your going to miss on 1 year ,but also you can do so much go apply to colleges and have a job because you would have more time for all the better thats coming to you.

On the outcome you would be helping yourself out spend your summer on school time or you can have less hours of going to school on evenings sleep in more in the miday. All 4 years you can be doing the total of 3 years you would just be doing fulltime but it's also the choice you make on evenings or in the summer days. Luckily you can do anthing what you want and could imagine if you can put your mind to it and it will appear better days. Although everything in life you will get because its how you want your future to be but if it's for you it will not go away. At any age you can graduate young or as a older person but when you do you will be a successful leader.

My main priority in life is school since I was a child I always love coming in to school it was always my focus in life to overcome the end of it. School has always been my favorite because you saw your friends and it's how you start your day also good connection than having a studying buddy to make everything work. A high school deploma is your way to the next door it's access to everything you will ever need later on to your future. After your done high school you will be feeling as a pot of gold apply in purssure and you will get there apply to many awesome colleges and now that you have time you can have a job.

"Due people has to do all by they self? Sometimes is hard to do all the job with out help. Or sometimes we only want some one who can we talk to. By working alone it makes feel alone. I believe that working with a group is better because we meet new cultures, we learn how to communicate and we help each other.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. We start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Also the food and the music from their country. Meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world.

We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new person's. We start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start work together and getting better by communicating. Communication is important for every one.

In groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is,

where the buses stop, etc. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. Be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking.

Some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. Know new culture's from different's parts of the world is fun. Communicate is something important for live and our society to. We give support, we get support by working in group. Interact whit people helps a lot and make work more easier.",human
"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

"Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free.

Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them.

Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment.",human
"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication. ",human
"I think that they should not do a homework club because what if students don't got time for that. A other reason would be is that many students don't do their homework nowdays so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now thats a differnt story. A other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a tend this homework club. Students should be able to do thier homework on there own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and that's just not right! My other reason why they shouldn't do the homework club is what if most teachers don't give out homework like i don't get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldn't get homework. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club? How long would this homework club be a hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school. Do pranets know about this club would they let their childiren stay after schook is a way for them to get home if anyone can't pick the student up?? Would this homework club interfir with any other after school clubs or what if students already do a club and they need help with homework but they can't go to the homework club because they have to go to the club they do. Does the whole school want to do this or just some students cause not this club would be worthless. In conlusion i think that they should not do the homework club.",human
"People discussing that by your own behavior the best way to influence other people , or are there better ways to influence. For Example, have a good behavior I make better person for influence to family and can teach to brethren thing good thing good in the future. Other people think, that influence to the children with bad thing not is good because they can learn thing bad in yours life. However, this can cause problems in the children because they learn bad influence of the person older and have bad record for yours future.

Children learn bad influence of the person older. for example, when a children see to parents smoking or drunk they learn the that parents make. have bad influence is when a person have bad behavior and bad behave.

Many person learn bad influence since children because the parent not the educate good and not the learn good thing.

Have bad record for future. For example, when a person it's in the prison or when to commit a crime, this person no can escape to other country because already it's register in the system of other country. Have bad record in your life no es good because this affect for the remainder of yours life. Many people that commit ofensa because not are person with good manners and too person that have children and not give good education the that teach the same that they learn.

In conclusion, the parent have that teach good influence and teach good behavior to the children because the children are the priority and the future of every country. For example, when a child and person learn to teach to the other good influence the humanity outside better because not have more crime and delinquency. This is very important because everyone of the person have that learn the good of the life and teach to the other the best because the influence the teach and also wreck.",human
"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that are impossible to change, because they had been said or think that you cannot change your first impression, when you at first meet or start knowing someone, that is not true because clearly you can change your first impression, even though it can be the same or different as the first impression you had at the beginning of everything, but you may also be insecure or confuse of your own thoughts and feelings.

I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people.

The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning.

The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesn't like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe.

In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong. Don't let first impressions to trick you because they may be wrong, you can change them if you want, but make sure to be secure.         ",human
I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.,human
"The quote says, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods

First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow.

Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather it's good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.

Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. It's another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger.

In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.",human
"Have you wondered why local companies and organizations plus the different schools doesn't add up well this will answer why? This prompt will try to figure out the answer of this question.

These local companies and organizations that allow students from different schools should interact certain professions.

Teachers and students can think of organization that allow other schools to join in that profession. I think i should do is help the students that needed help with the organization they wanted. If the employer wants me to visit I will say this if i get accepted for this job first of all thank you second is you probably want to go to my office. I chose this job is because I like to help other people with what they really need not want but need. Students should create new professions in the future so then the future students can access the professions that the students from the past did the same with teachers. The local companies can grow even bigger if they needed to. Some local companies and organizations hate students because they touch very expensive, valuable, dangerous items plus they don't even pay any attention to you. Others can be totally calm about it.

"Ralph Waldo Emerson believe that ""to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else you not is the greater accomplishment."" personally i disagree only cause now a days most young adults, child, and teens prefer to be around the same individuals who act, talk and basically does everything the same exact way. Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma ",human
"My Talent

A talent or skill is something that is unique about everyone. It takes time to develop a talent or a skill. A talent or skill basically is something you are good at doing. Many people have the ability to move their ears, but some don't. Most people like dancing and are good at it, so it is a talent. Around the world, many people have more than one talent. My talent is to sing and write music. Some people in the world haven't found their talent yet.

One way to develop talent is to try everything. If you try everything, you'll eventually find something you are good at. During this process you'll probably be trying different things you haven't done before, like sky diving. Even though finding a talent or skill might sound hard and take some time, it can be done easily. By trying everything you can find many actives you might be interested in. Soon, those activities might become a talent or skill. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way. Trying different strategies can be helpful to find a talent as well.

Another way to develop a skill or a talent is to make a checklist. You can make a checklist about the activities you would like to try. Most researches say, a talent is something you are interested in doing. If you are interested in baking, it might soon become one of your talent or skill. Simply by making a checklist, you can find many interests. Even though there are a lot of steps for making a checklist, you'll will find a talent or skill soon.

The third way to develop a talent is to go outside. If you go outside, you will learn and experiences many things you didn't know. Many people these days are stuck in there electronics and never notice the world outside of them. If you go outside and explore you'll find many interests and enjoy them. The world outside of us is big and has a lot to offer and has opportunities, like cooking, acting, sing, and e. t.c. There is so much that awaits in the world.

Everyone has a talent or a skill, if not, they can find one eventually. Three ways to develop a talent or skill is to try everything, make a checklist on activities that interests you, and go outside. These three ways can help you find a talent and your talent may help you find career. Sometimes the activities you are interested in and are good at doing, might not be your talent, because skills and talents can just be hard to find.

"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      ",human

"When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice.

If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

"Dear Teacher,

I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas.

As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work.

My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done.

To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because their are many advantages. Therefore working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because thats is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot information.

"Students use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and don't spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work.

Many student's when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we don't focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us.

For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that don't have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the student's and also for the teacher's.

I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.

"The statement is ""the first impression is almost impossible to change"" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. We are doing it unconsciously.

The first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. Sometimes it's the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time it's wrong.

Moreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. If the person do not smile and seems to be rude but in reality is the nicest person, then it will be awkward for you because you thought she was bad. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just don't smile every time. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didn't get to know the person because of your first impression.

The first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. If it's pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. But your first impression is wrong because you didn't take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person.

In conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time it's not. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, it's most of the time wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.      ",human

I think the students should be finish high school in three years because, they will can graduate of the university more early, they will get a job fast and probably they will can do you're life better, to age early and be independents.

In this paper, I will argument that in my country El Salvador; The High school is of three years. My old sister was graduated of the high school at you're seventeen years old. she enter to the university and now she will graduate of nurse at you're twenty-one years old, however, I feel that is better that the high school should be of three years because, I'm in the high school and I will graduate at my nineteen years old. I think that, I will late to graduate for the university, more if I take a profession of eight years to studies.

In my school, the students, parents and teachers voted, to know how many are agree with that high school should be of three years. The 70% of the votes was the answers that yes, they are agree that the high school was three years. Some teachers says that, is a better way that the students will can have opportunity to graduate more fast, since that some students don't pass the class or the scholar years. They have the reason because, my brother don't pass the scholar years, now he need to repeat again the grade nine. He will take five years in the high school not four.

My mom was graduated too at you're seventeen years old in high school. When she was twenty-five years old, she graduated of doctor and then she got a good job in the hospital. In the same time she went to night school because, she want to be too heart's specialist and she was graduated again when she had 30 years and now she have two good job, have better life. I think that she can graduate early, because she only got three years en high school.

Three years in high school is better way to that the students can graduate early. Some school districts are disagree with that but, they are wrong because, the students will can have more fast a good job, if they going three years at high school. In the future I hope that the high schools will be of three years not four. ",human
"Inactivity always serve a purpose

Thomas Jefferson wrote; of how ""wonderful much may be done if we are always on it nonstop.""

Will I believe, that inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. Although, some people may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time.

Inactivity always serve a purpose because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them. To begin with, that's why now in days we have Saturdays and Sundays off. For example, our bodies wouldn't be able to function without any stopping point. Next, we're not even going to be able to sleep with all that pressure building up on us. Lastly, even animals take rest after along day of hard work to continue on moving.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because your body won't shut down while your doing it. For starters, we can be working, but we might be falling asleep at the same time anything can happen. However, we might even get hurt doing work hours depending on what your job is. To finish off with, we can lose our lives while driving or cost others.

some may say we accomplish more if we are on it all the time, because we can get more work done and we can finish faster. First, we can learn something faster if we are on it all day nonstop without rest. Second, if we are on just on that we make better results of ourselves doing what we are doing. For example, if we are building an apartment or house you name it. We might just finish faster without a stopping point. It'll just take less time to get there, Just as a journey that takes you wherever you go without stopping. lastly, is great when you don't stop moving forward and accomplish your goals your'll make it.

Inactivity always serve a purpose, because in order to finish what your doing, you have to take breaks between them and your body won't shut down while your doing it. Still, some people may say we accomplish more if we are always doing something. In the end, I believe Is all up to you to determine weather or not to be Idle.",human
"I think that failure is the key to success in life, That means that without having any obstacles you are not going to succed. Churchchill's is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do.

If you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you don't know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can.

Make a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don' t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well I'm still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didn't know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I did't know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things.

I was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they don't speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life.

I believe that if you fail, try to do it again. Do what makes you happy and succed in your life. Make an effort and achieve your dream, because you are living of that, And if you fall down get up and do it again.",human
"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.

However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.

In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.

Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! ",human
"I want to visit Egypt because Egypt is a great country, I want to see the pyramids that are made from thousands and thousands years ago,and I want to see the great museums that are in Generic_City.

The pyramids are very huge. There are like 3 big pyramids and there like 6 other pyramids aren't that big as the first 3 pyramids. Pyramids are so hard to build to make them again. The pyramids need a lot of stone and it need some are like very big stones that are located in the very bottom of the pyramids,and it's hard to reach the max high of the pyramids because they are so high up. These pyramids are from the 7 fantastic and amazing things in the world because no body on this earth now can build these pyramids. The people who built the pyramids called the Pharana.

These museums have a lot of stuff that anybody world be interesting to see them, like people who died from thousands and thousands years ago, they did something like a magic or a process that keep their bodies, and the museums have their bodies.

"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.

In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what they're doing, and that's how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we don't know if it's real.

When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didn't have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now don't want to get out where technology is at.

Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, it's hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.

Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology.",human
"If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group.

"Students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. When students enter high school, they begin to work at a specific job to earn some money in order to be prepared for their future career.

It is not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work, students are still getting education, and specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage. Spending time on a specific job before their actual career can distract students and decrease their grades. For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have don't have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. So they begin to get a low grade and fail tests, which can also give them a low self-esteem.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because are still getting education. High school students are still young and are still developing, they need to spend their high school years to study and get a good education in order to develop. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and that's how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. A specific career will take them away from their dream job.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy. But they have to go to school and need time to do their schoolwork and study to pass. When they get a specific job, they don't have time to do their favorite activity and also not have enough amount of time to study and do schoolwork, which can cause stress to students.

In conclusion, students should focus on studying and education in high school and not get a specific career that will distract themselves from school or any activities they enjoy to just to get money. They have to keep developing and study hard to get to a good collage and be prepared for their dream job to get a good amount of money and live a better life.",human

"Working in a group is more benificial . Why is more beneficial working in a group ? because if you have a group your group can help you in ideas , writing ,examples and information. If you working alone you do not have someone who can supor your idea.

The benefits what you have working in a group. The benefits are you can talk with your group abuth the work and also you can hask cuesthions and you can talk abuth examples and than they can toldyou how they can do the work and the group can suport your ideas.

Working alone do not have to moch benefits. The benefits are you can use ideas of your shelf the other is not one goin to disturb you and you can put your examples but that will be more dificult because you need to find the information and not one goin to suport your ideas.

For example working in a group in high school the english teacher say the students goin to do groups of four. For do a progect the students say yes, one of those students say i will colect the information, the other say i goin to writing the information and the other say i will put the examples of the progect and other say i will reading the progect and also i goin to do a expocition in class is more good because you will stay more relax because the group is help you.

For example working alone in class, the high school teacher say we goin to do groups because we have a progect but if you want work alone you can do it. the student say i like work alone because no one goin to disturb in my work the studen can put ideas of him shelf but you do not have some one to talk abauth the progect. and you will have nebous inclass you will be distracted and boring.

Why some people do not like to work in groups? the people do not like work in groups becase they have problems with the people in the group meybe he do not feel well in the group or he feel some nervous in the group or because some people lika work in silent.

Why the most people like to work in groups? that is because the people like work with friends, he feel well talking with the group, he like answer the cuestions of the group.",human

If student are use cell phone in class for educational purpose than it's good and if they connected with social media or something else than it's effect to the study. Effect of phone like they connected with social media or something else , they cannot focus on study , or they cannot disturb by phone. If they use phone in useful then there is good like they can search anthing , they learn easily .

There are to many thing are helpful and to many are harmful. Some teachers are allow to use phone in class and some are not. If we want to focus on study than we want to use phone in class for helpful thing like to search some topic or some thing related to our study. We can use cellphone on social media after class or before class it's defends on students. If we use cellphone in class then it is helpful and harmful thing.

"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if

I

don't believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! ",human

"The reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington quote . First this is a good quote for students who are always working hard and make a lot of mistakes because they get motivated from this quote. This quote can make someones day better .

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

Example: Like I can say that for my sister, my sister she like art because she wanted to do art in her life, when she didn't know anything she was do art home and she was try her best to know art she wanted to know how they do art but now she do art because she try her best and the teacher tech her some thing she didn't know how she can do but now she she make art.

The student do that because art is make money better the art class is very good to them some student they take that class because they know that is make better to them, Some of them they do art home and they do in school and they ask the teacher to help them how they can make art because some people they want to make sure if they know better.

Some people they make art of the use of the Imagination the effort to produce beautiful objects, as by arranging forms, sounds, or words, some student they do group to make sure if they can help each other in class for art because if they don't help each other they can know anything They need to help each other and they can know each other some student they do that because art is make money batter.

Example: The other student they go to school and they take art class because they want to make money but is not to easy to know art all time or to make one day the other student they try to do that in their home.

The other people they believe that the art class is better to use,The art is make money to the other people that why the student need to take art class and art class is make better to them.

If they get in college they can do art by self because they can know anything if they didn't do in school that why they need to remember that thing they was do in school some student they do that when they get in college because they want to make more money and they want to do little business.

Some student they feel like they can draw something to make money and the people they can feel that the art is good to use, the student they cant draw some picture in class or in there house they can make to someone and they can to pay them the money if they pay them the money they can get more power to make art in her life some people they try that too.",human
"Education meals are important to students' ;having a meal given of our choice will help us improve obstacles that we phases everyday. A meal contains:the main course, a side of vegetable or fruit,and a drink of our choice. Given a healthier meal we will be productive in school,and our everyday life. Eating a healthier meal will reduce the chances of being obitisty. A lack of a bad food would result the chances of not getting enough knowledge,compare to having a healthy meal. The school cafeteria should serve a healthy meal.

Students look forward eating lunch during school,because lunch refuels the mind,and the body with important victims. Lunch is the second important meal of the day,because students look toward a short break during school to refill their body,and mind. Eating a healthy meal in the middle of day will help students pay attention during school. Junk food is bad to serve during lunch, because it won't allow the students to be more active during the day,and pay attention in class. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school.

Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. One of the main reasons why is because school lunches has served unhealty food. Junk food is unhealthy for the human body,because getting enough food will make you gain weight. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity.

Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee. If we don't serve healthy food the chances of being active in school will decreases. If we serve our students unhealthy food than they will be lazy throughout the day. Giving the students a healthy meal will make them be more productive.

Therefor serving your students a health meal for lunch will help them accomplish obstacles in school. Serving your students will help them improve of being smart. Knowing that if you serve your students healthy options on what to eat they will not be obese. Productive is based on what we eat.

"Last week, I had a math test on my first period. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. I was tired and tensed. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.

Those who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.

They say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.

However, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.

Also, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. Again, I can finish my school works quickly and take other courses which can help me in my future career or, may be I can do some other activities I like.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. Online classes can help us in many ways. Not only it will save our time but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.",human
"Hey my name is Generic_Name, and today im here at Generic_School talking with some of the students about life threating situtions where you have to take actions. let's say there was a lockdown in your school and the bad guy was at your classroom and he was banging on the door, and broke the glass window to unlock the classroom door now he found his way in! now the best thing to do is grab anything like books,desks,chairs anything you can throw at him.

Now lets talk about fire drills the best thing to do is not panic, you just got to act fast and think smart your main priorty is for you and your friends to get out the building safely. follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater dont inhale the smoke thats how you pass out from the smoke.

Now the last thing im gonna go over with these 5 graders is what to do when an earth qauke is happening, the first thing u wanna do is get underneath or sink something stable tuck and duck your head. dont go under something that can fall on you that could be very risky and dangerous.",human
"It was a really nice day so we went to the park. We were going down the slide at the park, and I was with my brother, and sister. If I haven't told you what their names are, I'll tell you right now! My brother's name is Generic_Name, and my sister's name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it.

My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. He had a really cute little sister, and she's two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old.

I asked Generic_Name what his brother's name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. When Generic_Name told me his brother's name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world.

Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got to know each other, and now we're best friends.

I'm so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. The saddest thing is that we don't go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers.

We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow It's going to rain, and It's going to be really muddy, and wet outside. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didn't seem as happy, as we all did. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. So we went to the library. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Name's ex girlfriend.

I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, she's my best friend, and she's always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name aren't true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address.

Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because she's jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didn't feel the same way as Generic_Name did.

Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. I really didn't expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. I don't trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, they're not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Girls shouldn't change over a guy that doesn't feel the same way as you do, and boy's shouldn't either! God has someone waiting for you!

If you really trust someone, don't loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see who's being a bad friend to you, and who's being a good friend to you. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust.

There's always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but it's okay. I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isn't even true, When someone lies to you, it's hard for you to gain their trust. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying.

Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that. Be careful in who you trust, and never change for anyone, because you are amazing just the way you are!",human
"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesn't ask for more than one option to choose from.

First of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Let's say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didn't know where this on store that she really wanted to go was. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said "" In the second floor"". She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said ""It's on the first floor next to the ice cream shop"". She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store.

Second of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, "" ""She looks like a high school"" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked ""Hey what's your name"" Generic_Name she said I'm in high school what about you"" ""Oh same"" Generic_Name said. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room.

Lastly,

Another reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do ""AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO"" she said freaking out. One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. 911 came and solved the problem.

Overall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. Let's just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.",human
"I think that students should take a art, muisc, and drama class. Cause by taking these classes they can learn more about what happens ineach classes. Also, if they do one of those classes they can recive credits on their GPA.

First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else.

Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play insterment like giutar, flut and many more. So, student can also impress them with insterment. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage.

Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. For example, students can impress their family with their amzaning talent. Also, with their talent they can go to different countriesand perform their and other places too and preform too.

In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes.

imrove with their talents and go around the world. ",human
"Technology is taking over the world! There is now less human contact. People may think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives, but that is false. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.

Health is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.

The use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Therefore, individuals get too dependent on technology; For instance, Individuals use technology to communicate with others and they use it for location. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.",human
"I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.

One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.

Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.

Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.

And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.

In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.",human
"should churchill's statement About the importnat role that failure plays in the pursuit of success be true. I think that failure plays a big role to success but is just for those who really want to changed their lifes. First of all, learned something from any failure. Second of all, A failure shows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over.

""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes. Second of all, a failure shows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. the person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over becuase the first think you loss is your enthusiams when you had been passing the same failure for many times, it becomes harded not to loss it. There is always gonna be more failures in our lives but, if u dont even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

My conclusion, everyone has a failure or more in their lifes but the most succes full thing of a failure is to pass the page knowing that you had learned something good of it and you wont do the same mistake ever again. Everyone has the opcion to change their lifes but the key word for this is that the person has to want it and be ready to changed.",human
"I disagree with this artical because is not always how you will see first impression is how you will see the person in general. Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Not all what you see is who it is sometime the apparance lies. People sometime lie to get something or someone. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention.

Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention. I sometime do it to but only because I fell left out of the group so sometime I act diffrent. I don't like it but is the only way that I can get people attention. Some people will like if they are them self because you don't what to date sameone and that person is not the person that you see in the pictur. Other people like to deceive other poeple only for the money, to play around with them or be bad with you.

Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Sometime when I act crazy is becasue I like someone or because I need sleep but most of the time is when I'm in love. I am very weird to be around. I like to jock a lot but that dosen't change me who am I.

Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. There are sometime that you have to impres other poeple like when you are trying to get a job. You have to look impresing so they can higher you for the job. Sometime it will need more then changing who you are.

"I think classes such as art,music,and drama class should be electives. Why should we be required to take art,music,and drama class if we are not interested? Schools should allow students to pick there classes. If we were allowed to pick our electives then students would enjoy school more. We should be able to like our electives not dislike them.

What if student had to take art but they dont like it? They would not try the work and just fail the class. What about drama class,not everyone enjoys it so it shouldnt be required. Not every student wants to sing or play an instrument. Therefore they shouldnt be forced to take a music class.

Although it would be great for some student not all would like those classes. Therefore student should be allowed to pick there classes. If they were electives we would pick classes that interest us and would actually try to do work. Students would pass their classes more. Therefore those class should be electives.",human

"Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things.

It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they don't use their time wisely. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends.

Instead of been idle, why can't we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home.

In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they don't want to involve in activities, or interact with people. Idle people are lazy, because they don't want to try out new things. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I don't like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it.

As a result of all the reasons and examples. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.",human
"I agree with the idea of after school homework club,because by actually coming to a after school homework club it can help you get better at the class you need help. We know some students don't like doing their homework and that's why they don't get good grades.

All we want to do is help them get better at school so they can be something in life,school it's important for learning and a after school homework club can help then. It doesn't matter if you get your answer wrong you learn from your mistakes by practicing you get better at it.

And by coming after school to finish your homework is great because you have time to do other activities after you finish your homework. Doing your homework is gonna help you be someone in the future. Homework helps you raise your grades up. An a after school club is going to help you a lot we all want kids to be good at school. I know some students think the homework is a waste of time but no it's gonna help you anytime in life. We should have a after school home work club it's better for our school and students all we want is their best in school.

But it's their choice to come after school to finish their homework I know we want the best for them but it's their choice we can't make them come. A lot of student are failing school because they don't do their homework you just have to try it homework helps a lot like in math,science,social studies and reading class being good at every class is going to help you in college. We need after school homework clubs in our school, every school should have after school clubs it's for the best for every school we all need them after school homework clubs.",human
"Dear. principal

I'll say the policy #1 because student its a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunch time. its also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up or they forgot something on there house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.

Bring cell phone in school is important because cell phone is not just for texting its also for emergency for your parent if you need something or you have to go somewhere after school. you can also call and tell them that don't pick me up because I'm going to my friend house and i call you when you have to pick me up.

"Some people belive that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art clases. Should students be required to take a class in arts, or should such clases be electives?

I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. students should take these clases because they're part of our daily activity. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take.

I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances.

Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them.

Well it's true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they don't know how to let them out. Probaly through arts, music, or even drama they'll be able to express them out to the world. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students.

For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. I believe those people didn't just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life.

In summary, music, arts, and drama should be required for students to take, and such clases shouldn't be electives in school or for students.",human
"Do you think that school students should have at least participate in one or more extracurricular activity, agree or disagree. I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. here are some of my reason on why i think that student should participate in a school activity.

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.                                                  ",human
"What I believe is that your either trying to get attention or really going through a hard difficult time and the people you already went to and gave you advice didnt really help with what you going through or trying to do. You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnt help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnt seem to do anything really. What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work.

They might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. They can be doing that because the person they went to first was not really giving them advice about what your going through and just throwing things in that dont even make sense. I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel.

Some people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through. It really is hard to find someone with good advice but you never seem to find a person that give you that one good advice. I would do the same and get advice from other people its just better it give you comfort and more things that you can do to help you ",human
"Are outdoor activities enjoyable? Outdoor activities are enjoyable for everyone people can play outside with they're friends and get a chance to meet some new friends. There are so many activities someone can do. They are a lot of sports people can play soccer, football, baseball and the list keep on going. outdoor activities are good exercise for everyone for the soul reason of doing something outdoors than doing nothing indoors people are getting more lazy and stupider by the day because of technology humans wast most of they're lives on technology than the outdoors. The outdoors activities help people to get more active. Outdoor activities on any season and weather. If it is winter and snowy it's a great time to go ice skating or snow boarding. If it is summer and hot then it's a great time to go swimming and it is a great time to head to the beach and go swimming on the ocean or to play sand valley ball. Then fall is a good time to throw a football around or to kick a soccer ball around. Spring is a good time to play soccer go running and to go bicycling.

What is some of your favorite activities? My favorite activity is soccer. I love play soccer because everyone can play soccer is easy to learn and it is simple to play. One thing about soccer is that it can be played at any time on any weather if it is snowy, hot, cold, and rainy. The best time to play soccer is on the spring because the weather is not to cold but not to hot it is just perfect to go outside and kick a ball or to play with friends. Then the trees and the plants look beautiful because they are growing during the spring. The outdoors is fun and enjoyable there are so many activites some can do so try some of them out. ",human
"The only talent or skill I have would be doing tricks. I also think that mostly everybody can do it so in my opinion that is not a talent. I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. I been doing it seen's I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports.

The first one I learned is soccer because it's just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isn't big as well know as it should be. In the middle east it's big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot.

The second one I learned was track it wasn't that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump it's like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite it's not about beating the other person.

The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion]. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls.

The next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. In school we have softball but we don't have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they don't. I wish we play it at gym but we don't all we do is play field hockey. Softball is also good arm excise if you play it all the time. Thats why of all the sport my favorite is track.     ",human
"Why do people ask more then one person for advice? I think that people stress out about the problem that they are having that I'ts better to hear it in another person's perspective, what If they have gone through the same problem that your facing, they all have different things to say so you can think about It in multiple perspectives.

I think that going to more then one person is a good thing because people may stress out about it a lot they may over think it and that's not good I'ts always better to talk to more then one person because they all have different things to say so you can think about it in different perspectives It actually helps you make a decision faster or it helps you with whatever you may be going through.

I think that going to more then one person is a good thing because what if they have been in the situation as you they have already gone through it so they can help you out and tell you how it was for them so you know you arent the only one who has gone through that problem it may also help by doing what they did when they were in that situation.

I think that going to more then one person is a good thing because they all have different things to say so you can think about It in multiple perspectives like you can think about everything they told you and it can help you with what you are going through. in conclusion i think that it is best to talk to more then one person for advice.",human
"I feel that this learning program can hep younger and older students and have a very big a effect on the people involved in the program, that is taking place in the schools.

Not many many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them and they need to take it.

This program helps the younger students get a opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do.

If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school.

The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time.

I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well.

This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school.

It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at.

They could possibly put this program on there college resume if they would like to become a teacher when they grow up.

There are many other reasons that this program could be helpful to others.",human
"Students and teachers have important roles in their life. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.",human

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.",human

"Take classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing.

"As we have two different people, we have two types of parents that one of them, they believe and they force their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.

In general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that is showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.

First, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.

Second, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.

Third, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all A's in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.

Finally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes.

In conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.                                           ",human
"I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills.

Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

"If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.

an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.

Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.

I also like to thing that I'm a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student

.

People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his life's. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his life's. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.

people have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person. He will has to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge.    ",human

but you don't have to give up you have to still Fighting so you can Solve all this and leave this at the Past .and start like nothing Happen and keep having that positive attitude on you. having a good a ttitude in school can make teachers see that you are a quiet and chill guy who just traying to do great on classes and trying to pass the school and graduated and be a better person than others who just having a bad attitude in school and quit.

thats why having a good attitude can make you be a good person with others and people see that. you can make all your wishes true if you being honest and prepared so you can be in the work you want for you in the future and make a better life to your self and your family.

"My name is Generic_Name and I conclude my subject of topic to one of my most enjoyable educational activities to be the of subject P.E. I chosed this subject because me myself am an athlete in many sports such as basketball,football,swimming,and lacross which is why i feel as if i have a great connection with the subject of P.E since the platform of the class is physicle education which most of the time includes sports. This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure.

I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed.

This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

I feel as if this interaction and connection in physicle education/P.E is a great enjoyable way inside of shool grounds that can provide a break from classes which you sit all day and study and is why i choose this as my topic of intrest when it comes to my oppinanated most enjoyable activity.

"I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits. That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too.",human
"How people live their life is up to them whether to follow their own decisions, or seek guidance from experts and authorities for life's important matters. People should make their own decisions because relying on others will make you less self-sufficient and you should develop your own self-identity not from the choices of other people, although some people may say that people who seek guidance from experts are smarter than people who do not.

People should be able to rely on their own decisions on life, so that they do not become less self-sufficient in the choices that they make. Firstly if you keep relying on others than you become someone who can not do anything on their own without the help of other people. Another reason would be that people might think you are unable to do simple tasks in life because you relay on other people too much. Lastly self-sufficiently is an important skill that everyone should have through-out their life. Your past choices defines who are you today, so if you relay on others too much than you become a different kind of person you once were

Other people who spend their whole life heavily relaying on other people develop no self-identity of their own. I highly doubt that Tesla or Einstein relayed on anyone if not no one on the work that they did. Additionally if you do not have a self-identity people will not remember who you are. Secondly if you always have people telling you the answers in life it is hard to live without those people who helped you in the first place. Finally always become a person who does not have to relay on others for the sake of your own well being. You should always listen to your brain and not seek out help too much, or it will affect your life in very bad ways

Still, some may say that people who seek help from experts are smarter than people who do not. That people who seek out help will be more informed in life, therefore they do not have to worry about the things they do not know. This may be true but it's better to find the answer on your own than to always ask for help from experts.

In the end you shouldn't rely on other people too much because it will be harder to be more self-sufficient and it will be harder to develop your own self-identity. People should be inclined to make their own decisions in life whether they like it or not.",human
"In this writing you will find some reason why, 4 years of high school and graduate are better than, 3 years of high school and compare the opportunities that you can find during this years of high school and also help you to make to take your choice.

High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower.

During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer.

In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school.

When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school.

3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like.

In my opinion 4 years of high school are better then 3 years of high school and in this 4 years of high school you will be able to graduate and you can enjoy the process of learning, and know a lot of people that could help you to graduate and reach your goals in the future.     ",human
"Students graduated in three year of the High School!

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student don't need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students.

Example:

A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. The student he's prepared every time for the quiz, and for test.

Finish the school the student is the best student of the year in the school because He passed all the classes and the SOL. During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal.

He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. This student continue that, He pass all the classes, and SOL that He need for graduated. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student.

He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer.

The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes. The parents of this excellent students, and good person, so they feeling fortunate for have a big son.

All we have the opportunity for to be a best person in the life, all depended how we wants to be in the life. Many student wants to have a excellent grade but don't put of they part for be a good students.

Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but don't want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but don't go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing.

We don't know appreciated the best opportunity of the life.

Reasons for graduated in three year

All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place.

why?

because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing.

Are a people responsible!

Why?

because when have a big responsibility never said 'NO' and have care for all thing.

Example:

I'm Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today.

Be carefully!

Why?

because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing.

Example:

My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time.

My Idea!

I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions.

When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. The thing are best when we support all bad thing.

The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they don't want to be a best person in the future.

Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street?

Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street?

Because many mother don't have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing.

Many mother having a bad decisions!

So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life.

Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do!

We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or don't put care to our thing for to be prospered.

Some time is good help take course when the people don't finish the school.

Example:

take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon.

take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity.

take a course for be some body also a little important in the life.

take a course for be a teacher of music.

We have so much course for prepare more when we don't finish the school.

Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students don't finish the school part of this is fault of the parents.

How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated?

The things for to finished the school is:

Go to the school every day.

Make the homework.

Prepared for the quiz or test.

Pass all the SOL.

Pass all the classes.

When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life.          ",human
"Positive Attitude

Positive attitude is the right choice it's like a no brainer. Also you will be happy, like who dosen't like to be happy. Finally positive attitude will bring success to your life and the people around you.

First reason is attitude effects the people around you in a different way. If you see someone who is feeling down go help them. If your always positive you'l get things done the right way without being stressed.

another reason success is great good things will happen around you even if you don't suspect it. Success will get you to wherever you want to be, but you have to be positive. If your positive, and a teenager you could nail your first interview you just got to be positive.

Final reason is be your self it's so important because being unique means your special and something good will happen to you in life. People will love who you are when you are yourself ,and get real friends who will help you. Don't be like everybody trying to be the same like every body.

Positive attitude actually helps without positivity you will get nowhere. Another reason bad attitude will make people dislike you and not want to be with you any more. Final reason bad attitude will get you to bad places.",human
"Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.",human

"We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.

I strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.

There was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.

The last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.

In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.",human
"Do you think that the school hours should extend?

School is already not fun for many of the students, and by staying more in school students may have a bad mood or adituted, and it may lead to bad behavior and not make them get good grades! I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school more longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to got out with friends or family.

The First reason, Is because if we stay more longer in school you are gonna get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not gonna have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we don't extend the school hours, we won't be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside.

The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you won't be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also you might have teachers you don't really like and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesn't have to be that way, if we don't extend the school hours.

The Final reason, Is that you woudn't have time to spend with your friends or family. Because most of that time you would be in school. ANd spending time with friends/family is the most important thing in life and school shouldn't take all the space froem your life.

In conclusion, I disagree that the school should add more school hours. because it is a waste of time, and it gets you more tired, it change youself, and it doesn't give more time to spend with friends/family.",human
"Wow! A talent I have is soccer, I have played soccer when I was born. Loved to play the sport because It always entertained me. So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. When I started playing soccer I used skills like communication,passing and shooting so then my coach said I had potential in me. So then I started to watch soccer in my T.V..Soccer got famous in the late 1800's. Also in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. Like professionals they worked for 5 to 8 hours a day. Well in soccer games I use communicating,dribbling,passing and shooting.

In my opinion communicating is the most important soccer talent professionals need. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup finals, he was only 18. His position was striker, he was known for his bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in different leagues used communication also to pass to ball. Everybody needs communication to win any sport game.

In my opinion you need skills to be good at the game. In one of my games I had to score two goals at least to win the finals in soccer then I two use my skills called the fake. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Messi he plays for Generic_City and won six ballon d'or. He used skills in games and in training. In my other soccer matches I used skills like passing and dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. So I used his skills for two games. So I saw professional players skills, so I can use those professional skills in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I don't I wont be active so those are my other soccer skills because I train to learn moves, running, and defense. I train everyday so I can get better and better. Other professional have to train everyday to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammates. I also practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I use it a lot in soccer matches and I really good at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he gotten famous and good at soccer. I train everyday when that happened to someone.

If everybody tried to play soccer it wouldn't be boring because it's fun, you can play with family members or friends, and you can know new people.",human

"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.

Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate.

Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality.

In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure.

It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life.",human
"Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow.

As we all know that, if the students doesn't have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer; though, their children doesn't have any interest on that faculty. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. It's only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel it's a waste of time. But, school always support him. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong.

If schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the student's bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength.

School knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their children's interest. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the school's coach. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday.

School provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it; only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. These dreams will be remain on dream until they do not get any supports from anyone, if they do not get any motivators to motivate them and also if anyone won't become their inspiration to inspire and encourage them. Similarly, school is that place which do not give their student's dream remain on dream; school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them; by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it.

At the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish student's passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities.

Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.",human
"First of all, the technology is really usefull and i think that it will have a posiitive effect in people's lives, the cuestion is how?. For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else. In the mean time you can use your phone and unload an app to shop somthing that you like, there are several things like clothes, shoes, food, tools, and other things that can be usefull for you or you child, whatever, and there is also the app for books; people don't have to take a lot of time loking for a book, they can just find it by put it in the device or the computter

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is. You can learn how to be an artist, how to cook, and how to fix something broken.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

Consecuently, the technology is developing more and more, we can built great things for the future and create more, eventually, the tecnology is not the only one that is developing, there is the science too because it help to develop other things and bring protection to people.

In conclution, the technology can bring positive effects to people because is a sounce of knowledge that you can use to inprove people's live.",human
"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

"The school board should add an hour and a half hours of school to each school day. Do you agree with this? Three reasons why school board should add an hour and a half hours to school are, students wouldn't have much homework, schools could add another elective to the day, and teachers get more teaching time. Help me do this!

The first reason why I believe the school board should add an hour and a half hours to the school day is students wouldn't have much homework. Most students have responsibilities after they get home from school. Some have responsibilities at home, work, and sports. Most students take care of their siblings when they get back from school. Others work after school and don't have time to do their homework. Also a huge amount of students have after school sports either inside or outside of the school, sometimes both.

The second reason why the school board should add an hour and half hours of school to each day is because schools could add one more elective. Studies show people become disinterested in an activity within an hour. If schools added one more elective to the school day most students would be on board with the hour and a half idea. Some people naturally like school and they want the hour and a half thing to happen. Instead of the elective this class could also be a study time for students that are struggling with a class or an assignment. This could help students grow their brain because they would try to understand it, instead of just giving up.

The last reason why an hour and a half hours should be added is teachers would get more teaching time. Teachers tend not to explain some topic well because they run out of time. Students don't ask questions because usually they run out of time. Sometimes the teachers is explaining to another student because they didn't quiet get it either. This doesn't mean the teacher doesn't know how to teach, it means the teacher made an effort to teach as fast as possible so he or she wouldn't run out of time.

The school board school board should add one hour and a half hours to each school day. Three reasons why I think this should happen are students wouldn't have much homework. schools could add one more class or elective,and teachers would have more time to teach. Do you agree with me? If you do help me make this happen!",human
"My name is Generic_Name. I am going to take a position about self-reliance, whether or not about if should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters. I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals and also they have more experience about life.

First, guidance from experts it can be much better, because experts can give more options, more ideas. Also you can ask them about what you need in life to be success. Also ask them about their life, how they did to accomplish their goals. Because if we are in any situation that we know we could not do it alone , we should ask them about any idea that they will give to us.

Second, those people they know almost everything about life, they could tell you whats steps you need to follow to achieve. As we know, billionaires people worked hard to be success, even if they failed something, even if life make them week, they never give up. they keep trying and trying until they make their dreams comes truth. thats why seek guidance is important for someone that want a better life.

Finally, in life we need help, even if we say that we dont need we need it. Because we can not do everything by our self. Thats why we should ask for help with people that can teach us about life. People that will give us tips to be success in life, because they have more experience and also because they know almost about everything.

"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place. Inconclusion I believe that havig a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequnces will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.",human
"(1)A talent I have is pranking people. Something that inspired me to do pranks on people was a

YouTube creator. He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas.

My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks.

my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off

Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it make us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is now a days, they is not that much joy in life more people then ever are sad so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.",human
"I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude and they are not success or probably won't be, theres only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that dont have a positive attitude and they are success in life.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but theres a couple of people that have a positive attitude and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people people that dont have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success. now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. for example it can be stealing or drugs if you are dong those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it wont be forever id rather work hard so i can be success in life ",human
"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.

Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you.

Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.

Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are.             ",human
"We choose our own character traits. Because you are responsible for yourself and waht you want in your life. A lot of people are going to defenetly critisize your traits and tell you that you are not good at this and that. Therefore you are responsible to succeed in life by doing the right things and using the right traits. For example if someone else comes and tells that you are not good at your job and you know you are doing good and everyone tells that you are doing awesome. And you are strong and cofident at what you do then you are good.

In the other hand people think that traits are formed by influences or beyond our control. But influence comes from our own family. For example our ancestor could have done the things that our dad or mom are wanting us to be doing. Therefore our traits are every good because our dad and mom already did the traits that our ancester thought them. Fortheremore we are getting strong and have the capacity to teach others about what traits are all about.

As a result the younger genaration is learning about a trait really is. Traits really means a lotin life becuase a trait definetly describes how your personality really is and what you are really good at. For example if you are good at playing soccer thats a persona trait. Sometimes it takes a long time to learn what really your traits are. But if you now you are good at something show the world who you really.

Our character traits are more important than we realise beacause it defines how you are. In addition our traits is what gets you a real job or a habbit that you have. Also character traits are you being smart you acting or doing other things. For example helping your brother or your friends at school is a trait because you now the topic and they dont. In Addition of this is waht deifnes your character traits.

In conclusion we are the ones that decide our traits even now our parents or other people try to tell us what to do. At the end we are the ones that decide our future and what really our character traits are. And where we to fully develop them. We just got be strong over come any obstacle.

"I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom.

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

We all must respect people's, teachers', and our time in classroom by not use cell phone to distract and lose the attendances' benefit in classroom.",human
"Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you don't want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend.

Going to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their ""safe spot"" which the safe spot would have to be far.

Another thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because it's fun but it's very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they don't mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If playing a sport is boring and not interesting to someone, riding a bike or a scooter is an option. Riding them is exciting and fun. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then it's fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. If I go out to bike or scooter I'm with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see who's faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter.

If going to the park or playing a sport doesn't interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. If you're with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. If you're walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if they're any near by, or the flowers. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if you're wanting to do something that includes being outside and you don't want to do anything then walking, running. and sky watching is for you. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because it's very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically.

Going to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if it's low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally. Fresh air we're use to being home all day and going out to get some fresh air willl cleanse you.",human
"There is a lot of ways to safe energy and conserve resources, but not all the pepole follows along with them. As an example for that could be, that every time people is not using a light at their house they must turn it off. Also when students use their computers at school for a long time just playing games and charging it, it's a waste of energy. Not every body understand how important the energy is. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours.

Having a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. On the other hand working requires using energy for any type of power tools as computers, printers, and construction tools. Working four days a week will decrease the use of energy.

Also some people drive to their job, and others ride the bus, using this method of working only four days a week will safe the people more resources, as gasoline, money, and vehicles.

As working four days a week has their benefits, it also has their disadvantages. students would have to go school, and workers would have to go to work only four days a week, of each day consisting of ten hours. Students would have to stay at school two more hours, meaning they would waste more energy as they usually do. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use. Students would only go to school for four days, and wokers to work for only four days as well, but each day constis in ten hours, however they still will work for forty hours, as if they worked five days a week, workers and studets will be wasting the same amount of energy and resources.

Being a student and going to school for only four days a week and having a three day weekend has their benefit. Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. On the other hand going to school requires to waste some energy, and resources, students uses their computer that they need to charge, and teachers uses paper every day, while using this method students and tacher would safe resources and energy. Some students drive to school, others take the bus, or they also drive to academies, this all relates to the wasting of energy and resoruces as gasoline. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school.

Students going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. Students would waste less energy than they do in five days, they aslo would waste less gasoline and money if they only come four days. Having this method the comminuty would safe a lot of energy and resources that can be need it for the future. Schools should follow this model by extending the school days two hours and waste less energy and resources. ",human
"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas

In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lie's layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.

In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.

I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it

In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",human
"I would agree with Emerson's in this world be yourself which is most important things . If we have confidence your own because we face with different kind of stutionan that we have to fight and difficult staff in life never give back keep working hard encourage find way that take of your stutional.

For example: If we start something new that took long time to resive that result we have to be patient for that greatest thing never get quickly every beginning took time for that accomplishment we are face diffcualte time like might field are might be win for first chance never lost our hope keep working hard.

don't depended to other people never improve in life because depended to other. In the world indefinite multitude or great quantity or distance make a difference a way. For all the world in every way ex acuity copies which look for all the world like the original. You should trying to become succeed in life to get of the way from problem find solution how to succeed in you're life.

First, trying as mach could doing make more successful this new world sometimes is life easy but, sometimes is not because life complicate and busy.

When start something for that need trying to resive achieve your pride. Those people are trying are working hard now the a have more power.

Then, greatest thing you have to skill which is more important that part of life also. Without skills never get achievement because everything bast on standing everyone the have special skills that make encourage and make them successful in the life. For example one person good in the reading some are the writing, some cooking, some are management, and some are making with hand ext... Those are part of skill everyone they had for that resance this greatest achievement this very important. Those people the don't a have those are more make terrible never couldn't solve the own problem the need the come to help them this is showing weakness a person. Some people thing the don't have skill this impossible but, never are used own skills the thing couldn't do it the always thinking negative they lost.

After, beyond every good thing the have achievement. When get our aschivemnt that made feeling proud your self encourage you doing good things that challenge of life the person make more successful.

I do agree with Emerson statement the encourage you working hard trying your life you would be get greatest achievement.",human
"Some people believe that in order for a student to put their best effort they have to go to a praise , as well as others think effort wil find others to believe that true self -esteem comes from an achievement. Achievement can make a students accomplish alot of things way in their life such as goals they have set ,

new things , and focus on things that have to be done .

As a student achievement could let students accomplish a lot of things in their life such as golas they have set . Students like to get their work done . Also have good grades that makes them feel confident about themselves . Try new things that they always wanted to do . Especially students wil be able to think that things can be accomplished by working hard towards it . It's accomplishing what they have set to reach true - self esstem because the more you accomlish as a students the more you want to do in your life

Having confidence in yourself can lead you to true self-esteem . It can let you do many things also your favorite things . Without a person having confidence in themselves can lead to negative things . It will make a student focus on what they are doing also what they have to accomplish in order for them to finish what has to be done . Having a postive attitude will make a person interact with other people , and make you look as a good person .

Students having true self-esstem is an important rule in everyday life . It lets you do thngs that you thought you wouldn't do .There is more socializing with people and learning new things by them . It makes students put the best effort in what they do . It gives new learning skills and become more smarter . Many students can become the best version of themselves with being postive at all times . It's important to believe that things can be done with being postive in what is ready to be done .Students should believe that having true self -esstem is important in things you do .

As some people believe a students work to bulid self -esteem , it's imporant to have true self-esstem because it makes you accomplish things such as doing great things , have self confidence , and have a mind of goals that can be accomplished . However ; it;s important to maintain a postive attiude to accomplish things .",human
"Yes, I do believe that imagination is important more than our knowledge. Albert Einstein is recognized as the most brilliant person who has ever lived. He used his imagination more than his knowledge, which made him accomplish so many things. He imagined things first, then used his knowledge to make that happen. If we couldn't imagine things, it would've been difficult for anyone to invent something or do a lot of things. All the inventors, who has invented things first used their imagination to create an image on their mind to see how it will look like, which helped them to make the item. Imagination helps us to accomplish our goal. It shows us what we can do to achieve it. Imagining helps us in many ways.

I always think or imagine before I do something big. I always imagine before making a choice or decision because I do not know how it will turn out. Sometimes some people think its funny and laughs that imagination can't come true but I do believe that no matter how hard is to accomplish my success, I will always try. My parents always tells me to imagine what I truly want to be when I grow, which is amazing. I think many parents are strict and tells their children to stop imagining things and always study, which I believe education is very important but telling someone to stop imagining is not quite right, Once I read in a article where it said that imagining thing is a natural habit and you will imagine things unless you have disability or blindness.

Once I also read a article that says that according to physcology imagining things is important for our brain . We imagine things everyday. When we are imagining things or just thinking, it helps to improve our brain. Scientist always has a prediction or imagines before doing an experience because they don't know what is going to happen. That helps them to be prepared so that if something happens their going to be ready for it. Albert Einstein had a an amazing knowledge also he believed that imagination is important, which made him be a successful person. There are so many celebrities, who wrote a quote about how imagining helped them achieve their goal. For example Taylor swift always imagined that shes going to be a singer when she was young and now she is a singer. Sometimes people can use imagination in a bad way like imagining to rob a bank but its not good, but they need to think deeply how it can affect them.

If you also don't use your knowledge can't succeed because you have to use imagination and knowledge to succeed, you have to use both. I will always remember this quote.",human
"Do I think we choose our traits? In this world people choose their pathway. What they want to be in life. What career they want to do in the future. Some people have not figure out what they want to do in their life. It is always up to yourself to make life choices and some people like to listen to other people ideas but not listen to themselves. Humans like to listen to their friends or family members ideas too see if they can help them out. I think people like to listen to others people ideas but their own idea which is showing they can not make their choices by themselves.

Many of the humans depend on their friends or family being their to help them out. Being part of this life is learning how to make choices by yourselves and going out in the world and making yourselves an adult. Kids that turn sixteen start looking for jobs so they can grow and see how the money and dealing with customers works. When I turn sixteens years old I went out to look for jobs i wanted that feeling where I could earn money. People would make fun of me for working at a thrift store. At that time I cared what people would say about me and I told my manger that the job was not for me. I would listen to people comments but it was not worth it because they are not going to be there in the future. The point is we let people make our choices when we can do it ourselves but we like to depend on others.

Some people can feel like the world make their choices. Someone who you do not know about can judge you for no reason. Some people feel like they have to make everyone happy but not make themselves happy. When it comes on choosing who will be our next president not a lot of people like to tell others who they will vote for because there is always a person who will say something about it. There was a time when I was in my government class and a student asked what i thought about our president and his issues. I told him how i felt and instead of telling that he agreeing with me he told me how wrong I am and I did not know anything about the issues and how the president is trying to slow it. It can always be a person who you do not know trying to make your choices. Even though sometimes we make our mistakes however I feel like we depend on others

When it comes to make out choice we like to learn from experience we been through. We like too watch other people do it or we like to do it ourselves. I think it happened too be before when I thought I was doing it the right way and I would look around my classroom and I would see the other students doing it differently. By the end of the class the teacher got all of us in trouble because we did it the wrong. I should have asked the teacher or kept doing how I was doing it before. I feel like some people do not have the confident in themselves. I think that is right because sometimes I over think about something that is not a big deal.

In this world we do not like to do our things. We like people choosing for us, making decisions for us, and depending on others. Some people take time to figure out their life and who they want too be in life. I think we like to depend on other people ideas and not listen to ourselves. Living in this world is always about making choices and living by those choices. Do not have to listen what other people say about what you think and how you should live your life.        ",human

"When you first meet a person for the first time, it is good to have a positive attitude towards the person so that they see a good impression of yourself and how you are as a person. meeting someone for the first time is a way to show them who you are but that impression never changes because they know that you are that person of character. theres many ways of having a good, bad, and persuasive attitude when you meeting a person, businessman, and even a friend. i think that the first impression towards a person can be like how they view you as a whole. it doesnt always have to be about character this could go for anything even including: movies, video games, and television shows. they can have a strong impact on you, even little kids that are growing up that watch TV, those television show have a first time impression towards them.

Meeting a person with a bad attitude/ impression can show you that they are not good for you or even around the people that you hang out with, many people tend to have the impression of a cool and awesome person when in reality they arent that person, many people try to put up an image so people think that you are ""awesome"" or ""cool"". leaving someone with a bad impression can have a big or negative impact in their life for example when you first meet a person you wanna date they could leave you with a good impression but over time that person can change the way they feel about you and you see that a they are changing as person which many people arent comftarble with change of a person. also having a bad impression on the job you are trying to get, wont get you the job because of how you are behaving or using words or even body posture says a lot about a person.

Good impression that you show the first time to a person meets you be kind and just have a good attitude so people will have the same to you. being good to people in life can alway have a positive outcome. dont always be god to people that treat you bad and run you over and over again.

i think its best to havea good frist impression to anyone you meet in your life because those people will like you and some will not like you at all, but being the best of yourself to your potential can be amazing at times but always have a positive mind set about impressing other people and its not always about impressingother people its also about having that thought of being your best at all times.",human
"If I would pick a enjoyable activity it would be art. I

would picked art because you can do anything you want with it. The reason I

picked art was because a long time ago I would be sad or mad. So I went to the consular and she told me

I can use art. And how will

I use it? I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art.

Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush won't be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you won't have to worry about messing up.

It's also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it. Like I read artist that used dots to paint and draw I thought that was enterested so i tryed it was kinda of hard. But I enjoyed trying it. This is why i like art becuase you can use it for anything. what is your favourte thing to do?       ",human
"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time.

Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time.

People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or don't fail.

The British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesn't happened in the future.

Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the name's for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesn't always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time.

Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life. ",human
"People should make their own decisions about life's important matters. i agree with this statement because once people get older as a person they know what they are doing and what they want. another reason is high school, people are a teenagers and people are still learning, but sometimes make mistakes. moreover when people are eighteen they start to make important choices and actions about their life.

When a person gets older they learn between right and wrong. for example a person should never spend their money on something they don't need and knowing if they do they'll be broke and have financial problems. people know what are the needs and wants in life, they learn this through out life and the one to make the decisions.

High school is where people start to have an idea or know what you wanna do as a career. In high school you get to meet a lot of people and make new friends, in addition you make a lot of decisions. The decisions people make and ask their self are, should i be friends with this person, should i go to this class, and sometimes people don't wanna continue school. more over people wanna experience a party in high school so they sometimes make the decision to go and drink or do drugs, but end up getting in serious problems. In the end people make the decisions.

When a person turns eighteen they are an adult now and probably out of high school. People are either in collage or working when eighteen. That's a decision people make before graduating and thats a very important life choice. Sometimes people make the decision not to go to collage or sometimes go to collage then drop out and thats a decision a person makes because they think its the best for them.

in conclusion people make decisions and learn from it. People know between right and wrong, need and wants, and what they wanna do in life. You also make mistakes in life and sometimes you need to make that mistake in order for you not to make the same decision again. At the end of the day people know what they want in life and know the decisions they make. Guidance from others is a idea or option, people will still have to make the decisions.          ",human
"The best thing about on this statement is how can I learn about us, maybe are you will say how?

well that easy we have to see who we are or maybe what we going to do

I have a many reasons to show and too see how can I show the people who we are?

well that's easy.

The first thing what we have to see is how we wanna say the thing examples we don't have to never give up never say no just do it and you not take care what the people is wanna say you can do whatever you want in your life just work up for it because we never did know what is wanna happened if you not take care what you want

The big reason I have in my life is some people want the thing we have maybe can be the opportunity the education family

Always i say the education is always came from the family because there is your power or your support for your future that why we have to be positive on that because we ready know that some people want the things what we have on us.

The opportunity what we got everyday or whatever we get we always we have to be thankful with everybody.    ",human
"Do I agree or disagree on Ralph Waldo statement well I agree on what he is trying to say because you can master beyond something and get somewhere in life.

Also following your dreams and do what you want to do. Try not to follow anyone's decisions they make for you because it's not right for them to do so. It's your path to choose what you have set in life. You can master things in life if you believe in yourself and never give up. But people can tell you that you aren't too good for things and you should give up on everything.

If you were to master something important you will get somewhere in life. It can start by graduating from any school. If you mastered graduating from school it can get you a new job where you can do something better and you can grow from it. Also you can be willing of having a family , that for me it's a huge thing to have because they will help you get better opportunities. However mastering what you can it can take you to places and you can improve to becoming something better. Trying your hardest is a big key note because if you don't you may never get to become what you want and you may never grow from it.

What do I want to do and should I follow my dreams or goals. By following what you want to do you can become the next big singer out there. If you want to achieve something no one believed you can do you can become the next president. Also by thinking out of the box it can make you do things you have always wanted to do. However if you believe in yourself you can be a professional soccer player without being so ostentatious. But people can bring you down and you can always bring yourself back up if you believe that you can do it.

How can I not try to follow anybodies decisions they make for me. Well you always have to make sure that things are about you even if you don't want it to be about you. People can make you do things so you can give up on something you set you goal on. Don't listen to what they say or on what they want to tell you. It's not good for you to have negativity around you. Also you have to efface on what people have to say about what you do or how you are going to do it . However make your mark and show them what you can achieve and make the people who believed in you proud that you did it.

When someone has something so positive to say that can change someones thinking I have to agree to what he or she has to say and it's true we do have to master beyond something or we will never grow. To never give up on following your dreams and what you have set your goals for . Also try not to listen or follow what anyone decides for you and try to make it about what you want it to be . If you mastered that goal by you having them set then you will be going to places and having great opportunities. It's hard if you don't do things you have set your mind to because you will go nowhere. But you can always get advice from people whom you think will help you out.

"I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.

Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.

At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. When we took our test we both got A's. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.

During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.

In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.",human
"What are we in the future. Who are we now from then. How did we get this way. The fact is a lot of people are born everyday. We can not stop who people are and become. Character traits start in ones teenage years. When you grow big you keep some and throw some. If it was your choice or some else who influence. There are a lot of people who change them selves. People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you.

When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You can't have character if you don't want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you. Like right now there are to Women right now one is dressed nice has done her hair. She like to be fancy she blow her nose outside. She teaches Spanish I think so she travels for sure. She actually beautiful so you know she married. This another women is dressed causal and is wear a school jacket. She has a bun

But seems to be nice. She teaches science she most be smarts.

You thoughts of a lot of traits for them. How do you think they built them. They lived in different house and different schools and have a lot of different traits. Everyone can different trait and same one. You can never find someone with all the same traits. People see them in other and copy. People learn from them selves and make them. Traits are something you learn and keep.

Now if traits were something beyond your control thats different. If something beyond are control was doing this you'd think different. If you are talking about TV thats cool yeah I think so but not like that. TV is kinda like school but a lot of different things. You learn a lot of things from the TV that aren't the same. So you build off that. If you are talking like someone controlling of thats a whole different story. People would be more a like and thats how you tell we are in control.

People make their on character always. People will always be different from others . We all want to be are own person in the near future. Who wants to be someone else thats boring. We make new character and be are selves. We have control over who we are. You can live the same life as everyone and end up different. You control your own life.",human
"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.

One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.

When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.

There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.

Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",human
"So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!

What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. Like here's an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and does'nt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and it's always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But it's hard when you are nervous.

How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.

Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.

Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think it's better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world.",human
"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea.                                    ",human
"I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to a end for humanity if we dont take actions.

However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there.

With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing.

Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments.

In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

"I agree with this prompt or sentence because it the truth. A problem is not just a problem it a way fro a second chance and a success in life. A problem dose not mean your a life is over or i can not go back to redo it again, yes you can it your life you choose how to solve your problems. An example, having an F in your test dose not mean it the end no it not it the beginning because that how you start by giving your self a failure path and make it a success and that how a problem start. A way to solve a problem is like in school, at home, in the street, is talking it out with someone who can help in school you can talk to you teacher your consular, at home you can talk to you mom, sister, dad, brother, in the street if it a fight talk to each other, cause a street is not a place to fight. When having a problem you will know because it will give you this negative feelings like you are not perfect you can do anything right, you should know that failure is a lead to problem, a problem is a lead to second chance, second chance is a way to be success, just so you know giving yourself a second chance and accepting second chance when someone offer it that like the best thing in life cause keeping the positive spirit is what and giving yourself a chance is what other want so use it like you use your phone.

"it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

You needed be prepare every time, If you do, You can study in the best university and achieve your dreams.",human
"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Personally, I would rather go to my house, and eat spaghetti because people need to realize of what career they would want to choose if they would want to succeed in the future. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers.

People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. Some teachers think it is a better idea to think of a career in high school, yet some students disagree with the teachers. Students in high school need to understand that if they don't like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future.

Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Some students think having impression won't help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. Generic_Name went to college with impression, so she had the confidence of choosing what career that she would like to choose at a older age. Impression isn't for everybody, nor it is for some students who need of help finding a career in high school or college. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college.

Support is also good too, for people who aren't confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. The reason why they don't believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. People also need to support young kids that having a career is a longtime changing, so they would have to think about it in college, and not in high school. Generic_Name wanted to become a doctor, yet she didn't do well, so she gotten support to look for another career in college. The reason why I like support, for I wouldn't want to brainstorm careers by myself.

The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. Even people do want to commit to a career at a young age they would still need to know what to do to learn in college. Thinking about a career isn't easy, yet some students don't take it seriously of what career that they are committed to. These are all the reasons why I think we should have time, impression, and support. We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.",human
"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home.",human
"It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for at three seconds you think you know that individual already, Until you have a conversation with him/her for at least ten seconds your whole impression will change with a ""blink of a eye"". However, I disagree the first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual. From your first impression when you look at them.

However the way a person looks from your first impression isn't always who they really are. Base on you information on someone aren't ever really true. Meaning looks can be deceiving. Ex. The guy/girl could be the cutest person you ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. This also works vice verse. Ex. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. Until you met them and started talk to each other. That's when you realize that this person is the one for you. It's like saying don't judge a book at its cover. Until you opened it and read it. That's when you really like this book. Sometimes a personality can be a huge factor on your first impression.

Neverless personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly made up of whom you are. The basic qualities, and beliefs you have on a individuals. Find out who someone can be a life changing event for yourself not knowing who someone really is can have a big affect on you, because you really don't know who you are dealing with. Personality provides great insight into individuals and their lives. Being honest no matter what with someone can build a strong first impression on yourself and the person right in front of you. Showing the courage to do what's right in those situations, being loyal at your friends and love ones are good ways to boost you relations with another individual. Having the drive to keep going can rise-up your personality and your first impression to a different climax. Communication is key to your first impression.

Furthermore, communication skills consist of verbal and non-verbal by transferring information to another individual. Communication involves displaying confidence, and passion to show that you understand the individual topic by being eye contact and hearing all information that they are telling you. By you giving your honest opinion on a situation can grater your chances being with that individual, when keeping an open mid and resisting to give your quick judgments are clear signs of good communication skills.

Additionally. I disagree that first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, their personality,

and their communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view on a person. In other words, looks can be deceiving personality because being honest no matter what is key, and communication skills are caused by you first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours, and efforts to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging book by its cover.            ",human
"Why high school school students should not take school programs that allow to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years .Students who take this program most take class after school , summer time or they not allow to take elective courses .Consequently students who take this program have less time to do homework, spend time with family or friends, enjoy the summer time or they not allow to take important elective classes like, foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE.

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early. But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem. In conclusion thats why high school students should take early graduation program. ",human
"Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you.

To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesn't impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You don't have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire.

Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.

However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something.

Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

"""I would identify you playing an online game such as cahoot, coolmath, and theres lot of other games you could play online that will help you learn something. The thing is the games are fun to play and are educational.

There is also coolmath it's not one particular game but its a website with tons and tons of games you can play math games there really fun.

The games are fun because you get to play with your friends and specially on cool math there is this one game where your a cube and you have to run and theres levels it helps you with geometry. ""I would say lots of people that go to public schools have played that game because it's just that popular and fun. Especially cahoot every kid that attends a public school has played this game either to study or just have some free time.

""Im not just saying you have to play games to have fun while being educational but it does really help a person out some kids would just rather maybe get a book or do the work straight up and thats also good but sometimes you could enjoy playing games and those games are enjoyable and help you learn to ""I really suggest them. But there are other things like doing a science experiment you could find interesting things that you never knew before, also playing an instrument ""if you enjoy music thats really fun you can learn how to play a instrument,You could also be in a play if you like acting anything that fits your interest and is educational you should try it.

"Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!",human
"Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",human
"Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesn't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI.

By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle.

There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.",human
"Tomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonerful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

In this prompt I thinki that Tomas Jefferson was triying to said is that people have to determinate to never be idle to always do something, because after that you will see how much things you may done, and there always 2 types of people . The pople who would be agrere or not agree with this frase. That is why some people may think that is not always necessary to do something or work hard for things that we want, because they think that we can work for our things when is their necessary time . Also some people may think that you need to do something when things are really necessary or when you want something. I hardly believe that the frase that Tomas Jefferson wrote is totally true. We need always been working in our life to get wonderful thing , as he said is wonderful how much we can done whit things if we are always doing something for it. It is also that we that he worote that sentences, because I can totally feel how he specificly said "" Determinate never to be idel "" I take that sentence like never let yourself be that.

In the world are so many people negative that always think that we cannot get that things that we want that is always the reason why people become lazy with their dream , because they always think with negativily.

there are many people outside looking for a excuse to be idle.

In conclusion I hardly believe that I'm totally agree with Tomas Jefferson because we can keep working or doing something because after that, we would see the things that we have done or our resuts that our hard work. Just we need to keep doing something or working for something great in our future as a person succeful that we want to be.",human

prompt: School program

""Life in high school"". In high school to ca be graduate and learn how the new life is in here, and learn a lot of things to adapted or to fit to the new language and the new people what did I say new here is another world, new people new language that is why I'm here, I came from to my native country. To learn English and speak like a normal person like I speak Spanish, speak bout same without of problems. I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

I thing was I good idea taking just the three years to can be graduate on time.

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing. And here I am in my last year of high school I'm a senior I feel good can be say this is my last year here and all this help me for the program what they made for us to graduate in three years that helps me at all.

In conclusion; I enjoy the must time in high school I know was and is a big way to run was not easy but also no difficult when we want just put in your mind what you want and if you want you can this is my lemma don't give up at the last moment we can cause if you want you can nothing is impossible in this life don't lust the time because the time is like gold I know all this no to much relate about the prompt but I'm know did I doing well believe in yourself. one of the things did I'm thinking about what I going to do after school is going directly at collage don't lust the time did I win. Was the perfect idea graduate in three years that helps me in everything I'm agree wit that program and idea of the district. thanks was hard.",human
"There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. Otherwise, they will not get enough credit to graduate in three years instead doing it in traditional four years. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.

Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.

Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.

Secondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.

Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.

Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.

There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.

Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life. ",human
"I agree with this statement becaues I think that unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in you life. some poeple try very hard to mastered thing in there life. for examples poeple will try there best do mastered something in there life and with there friend and family.

first some poeple try very to mastered something there life they are not good that. and poeple try to be a good friend to there best firend. poeple try very hard, to keep there jod and to not get fire for there job becaues they need the money to pay bill at home and food to there famliy.

at lest poeple, if you try to do somethig beyong you will not never grow in life. poeple go beyond thing at they are not good at and the try very hard be at end they fail and get sad about it. some friend are good at mastered vidoe game and they play vey day. some friend get mad wind they loss and then they get into a fight just beaues they loss to a video game.",human
"Are first impressions impossible to change? No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to "" fit in "" or be someone who they really aren't but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time won't matter. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people don't act like themselfs.

A example of why I disagree with ""first impressions being hard to change"" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look "" bored "" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed.

Another example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast. So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didn't affect me after all.

So in conclusion , no , I don't think first impressions are almost hard to change. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.",human
"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. ",human
"Nowadays, the majority of students in high schools do not think about their future for many factors: time, dedication, or buget. Schools are a very important tools to help students to realize how important is to to commit to a career at a young age, because It is something that will help them for their future. It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them.

One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society.

Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals.

In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age.

In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.",human

"Do you think getting advice from more that one person help you make a better decision? Yes I think getting advice from more than one person help's you make a better decision. First getting more than one advice from someone help's them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they don't need. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advice's together to make one big advice.

While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial. Getting advice from more than one person is more profitable than getting it from only one person. Getting advice from more than one person can help you really think about the advice's people gave and you can benefit from the one's you understand. When you get the advice's from those people they want you keep it so you can use it in future. You can get advice from anyone but you have to understand the advice that will benefit you.

When you receive multiple advice's you can combine all their advice's to get one big advice that summarizes all the advice's you were given. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. When you get advice it's to motivate your self to do more. When you get advice from more than one person it's usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advice's is to either improve or be successful.

I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision. First getting more than one advice can help know what advice is useful and what advice is not useful. Second you can a lot of advice from more than one person but you combine all the advice's you got into one big advice. Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial and it can help you come up with your on decision on what advice is good for you.",human
"Imagine that you like photography but they required you to get music, art, and drama instead of photography they will be upset. Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because it's their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes.

If you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they won't do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say it's required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if it's for whole year I will choose they aren't required.

I think they aren't required to take those classes, because those classes aren't meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class.

In conclusion that, if they choose it's required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take.                                                                                                     ",human
"Working idenpendently is harder than working as a group, but it's also better to learn things. Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. When I state that you can ""learn"" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has they're own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done. Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed.

I think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Yes, i'd probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. Some people choose not to work independently but I do. One reason why I think it is better to work alone is because of the fact that after your done you'll feel relieved and happy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently.

Working as a group isn't bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits.

Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused.

Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also it's hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group.                        ",human
"Something that i would like to accomplish is raising and taking care of my baby bearded dragon, until it is fully grown and ready to start breeding. I have to feed my bearded dragon its required insects covered in reptile calcium, and bearded dragons need proper lighting. Bearded dragons need these requirements so they can grow up to be healthy and strong, the calcium covered insects makes the bearded dragons bones strong, the UVB lights also help the bearded dragons bones. The climate of a bearded dragons natural habitat is very hot since they can be found every where in Australian deserts.

I want my bearded dragon to grow up being friendly, and not so aggressive, so since bearded dragons are social animals they often need to be in contact with a person and keep being played with or can be taken out of its tank and let it roam around the room. Bearded dragons need to get bigger tanks as they grow old because they get bigger and more curious.

"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. I think it's a positive effect on peoeple's lives. It can make there lives way more easier. Someone may not like going anywhere to check out books and shop so they prefer to order them online.

Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesn't wants to attend public school so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they don't have time to attend so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff.

Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesn't like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they don't have time to go to the store and don't have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff but it can help you find an item that you don't know where it is without speaking to another person. There are many stores that you can check out by yourselves instead of waiting in line for another person that can ring you up. Technology helps a lot of people's lives in shopping.

So yes, I think technology has a positive effect on people's lives. It helps them in a lot of ways. Not just ordering stuff online but also physically.

"I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.",human
"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they don't understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.

Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.

dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you.

Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and that's that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.

In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

"In some areas they have their students pick their career right when they enter high school to help them, but personally that is not a good idea for students. Students may choose a career, and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. Some students might even feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Others may argue and say that having picked a career at that point, and be sure about it may feel that they are ahead of everyone else and prepared for the future. Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. Students may feel overwhelmed, and not like or take serious the career and courses they have.

Students may choose a career and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. They might feel like that is not the correct path for them. Some change their mind because they may feel like the courses are to hard, or that the amount of work is too much. Others may change because their parents might not agree with that career, because its to complicated. Students may not have fully made up their mind yet if they even want to keep studying anything after high school. In addition, if students change their mind once they might keep changing their mind again and again, because they want to experiment other careers and courses.

Some students may feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Kids may get stressed or even overwhelmed with knowing they have to choose something. As well,some students might already have jobs and it could be tiring. Some students could experience great amounts of anxiety, because they may feel forced to take those courses to succeed later in life. Furthermore, students may not like that feeling when they have to pick and rather give up. Some schools could help pick, but students may not like that and feel more pressure. For example, just having to pick regular classes for the year is somethings to really think about, because you wanna take easy classes but yet succeed as well. Adding on, having to pick your career in even harder and super stressful.

Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. They might think that its cool and fun, but not realize that it is a bad idea. While they start to spend more time together they could get super annoyed and agitated with one and other. Some of them might have actually like the career they chose and want to do good in the courses they take. In addition, the ones who actually want to take the classes and succeed wont let them if they get annoyed at each other. Teachers and parents may even realize that it wont be a good idea for other peers.

In conclusion, having to pick a career to succeed could be stressful. Students might not be able to enjoy their teen years, because they are focused on other things. Other may also agree that being prepared for the future and having plans is a good thing, and young adults can be prepared for it. Other may disagree and say that kids need some freedom and enjoy life as young adults. In addition, students dont need to have all this pressure and just be able to take regular classes and if they want to take classes that do help with their career then, let it be an option for them. Students may be overwhelmed, and not like what they had picked.",human

"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.",human
"A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually don't find it because they don't have experiences and these employers don't want to hire them just because of that .

Although, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .There's a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up. My father didn't found a job too and he is mom was sick and he had me as his son so young . He had no experience in any domain and he needed a job pretty badly to pay the rent and grandma's surgery . But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences.

First of all ,an employee doesn't need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people .

Second , it's not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You don't certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :'Everyone start out as a beginner "", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . But you need to prepare for it thought because you don't want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you don't know anything about it. My father told me that mostly the workers that don't have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees.

Third, I don't know why all these employers don't give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , there's a lot of people that didn't even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didn't accept her as a teacher because she didn't had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and that's how the students will learn pretty easily , that's why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences.

Finally , It really doesn't matter if you don't have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work you're going to do and not the work you have done , and I'm pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and you'll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .",human
"Four-day School

Debate between benefits and disadvanges. Resume any doing school activities on regular five school day and change that for only four day.

To have a four-day school week, is an option that has to be adopted not only for some of the businesses workers and also by each high school and higher education school after see this reasons.

That is consisting of lose ten hour per week. but those missing hour can be recoup it by extending the school day two hour and increase the time for each class per day, that is an option to increase the atention and time on each class and complete any proyect or assigment toll by your teacher, and if we get the extra two hours, we can get more time with friends and teacher for suport between us on any class someone is failing.

Also, we can adopted an option for the fourth day on the extra two hours, used for time on the library, that can be amazing for the sturent who love reading, or students who love extra time on the sports, or any activity after school.

The fifth day of the week can be used for doctor appoinments or any health situations, you know the great excuse for missing classes on regular school time is because the parents write a note explaining we will be absent of some periods of classes. Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.

Without forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.

Don't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.

Another opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.

Considering:

Only four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)

three free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)

No wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)

This idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.

Always remain. BE ON TWO DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES PER DAY CAN BE HARD AND EXHAUSTING, going school than going to work is exhausting because you don't have time for rest. But, if you get only four school days even though the school increase two hours you will have time after school for rest and doing any proyect or homework and use the other three days for any job you think is convenient.

Knowing disadvantages also remain the solutions and benefits for each disagreement on this proyect, because there are ore of the benefits than disadvantages for more 90 percent of the students.

After mention all points on considering benefits and disadvantages and solutions on that. To a four-day school week. Willingly I conclude with ""Everyone need a three day free from school and just four days on school"". Even though if any student's situation is diferent for using this free day, stay in home, family rutines, helping on home rutines, working or studing. And considering we every one are agree with all on this document, we all together will have the power to do a fight for this new right on high school and college's sturents. ON THE SAME POWER, TOGETHE FOR A NEW RIGHT.",human
"My school should not follow the model by extending the school day two hours. A four day school week would be wonderful but, however, student would not like the fact that they have to stay in school for two extra hours. If my school extend the day for two hours; more students would skip class and not come to school. Some parents would be mad because they would spend less time at home with they children because of that. Generic_School should really cut school week to four days. I Think that its really unnecessary to extend the school day to two hours.

If My school decide to extent the school day by two hours, class would be longer and student's would get less sleep and come to school tired everyday. They can only extend the school day if we only go to school tree days a week. A four days a week school is still too much for kids to be going to. A bunch students barely wants to go to school for a whole week. Some student wouldn't have enough time to stay back in school for two extra hours ,because they work right after they get out of school.

Parents would be really mad if they had to wait two extra hours for they kids to get out of school. Most parent would rather they kids to stay in school for the whole week so they can get out on time. A four-day school school week would be good but staying in school for two extra hours is not worth it. Students would be in school for almost half a day if they stay back for the two hours. I rather be on my regular school schedule.

If Generic_School extend the school hours, kids would have more time to run the halls and skip they classes. By adding extra hours to our regular time , kids will have more time to get in trouble or get suspended. School shouldnt be no more than 7hours long. Every students should go to school on time so they can get out on time.

Extending the school hours is really unnecessary. Kids shouldnt stay in school for extra hours if they got to go to school for a whole week. School should just let out on regular time so the students could go home and get some rest. We should never have to stay in school for extra hours unless if its snowing outside. So its best that we stay on our regular school schedule and not add extra hours.           ",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. How would this affect students? this can affect students because they can get distracted by video games or phones. The problem is that some students get online classes but they just want to sleep more and than they don't do the online classes work or they play video games. this is why this is a bad idea.

first, one reason of why online classes will affect students is the distraction, for example they can get distracted by video games very easily by a friend calling them to ask if he want play, or by get bored get the phone and see they instagram.

to continue, the second reason is because they get sleeping to late at night and wake up to late, for example they can get sleeping late at night watching TV or playing video games with they friends. Some might says that online classes can be beneficial for students, but they don't know if the students are really working in they online classes because the distractions of video game or phones.

So the problem are some students who only want the easy way for everything include school.

the online classes are a bad idea because the distractions like video, phones, no sleep during night, or instagram.

To conclude this theme, I just want to remain you if you are taking online classes or you go to school, please do your best to be successful in life.",human
"There is two ways of working at school, one is to work alone another is to work in groups. Many people choose to work alone because it more quiet, the grade they get on the activity only affect themselves and not other people, and not distracted from other people around them. but i prefer working in groups to be with friends, get things done more faster, and more fun.

Working in groups is a advantage because the people on your group can help you in many ways like to know something you dont understand, or when you need help they can help you in what you are straggling in. in one occasion when i came to the united states i was at school and that day our teacher told us that we have to do a project and she gave us the option to work alone or to work in groups, so in that time i was a little scared and afraid to talk to people since i didn't know any English and i also was scared of people to not be able to understand me because i did not know any English i knew some words but not a lot, but a girl name Generic_Name came to ask me if i wanted to work with her and her friend, and i said yes, it was a lot of help working with them because i didn't understand anything the teacher asked us to do and what the project was about but they help me a lot to understand everything and to learn a little more English and to develop my self.

Working with other people it more easy than working by yourself. people can get things more faster, and more good because more people more ideas. Getting things more faster is beneficial, teachers can give students extra credit in their activity or project. Also students would be able to know how to work in groups in their future job, to make friends, to become more independent, and to be nice. working with other people would get people to know how other people feel and to get to know more people to become friends. My first day of school i was afraid to not make any friends because i'm not a social person, but them i become friends with a girl name Generic_Name because of a project i was doing with her, and since that day i'm still friends with her.

One of the reasons why people like to work in groups is because a lot of people are really nice in many ways. working in groups is a better idea than working alone because when people work in groups they get more social and to be able to know and to conjugate with other people. Being nice to other people it help you to make friends and not getting people mad at yourself or dislike yourself and to make things fun and good. when i turn 16 i started working at a restaurant called Generic_Name i was a little scared because it was going to be my first job i didn't know how things were. but when i started i have to be nice to costumers since i was working on the line. but one day i was sad and mad at someone about something they said, but that day i was working in a project with some people and they started to be nice to me and make me laugh so my day can get better so the reason here is that working in groups can be a lot of beneficial because that day it was a really busy day at my job but because of the people on the group i was working with, they made my bad day to a good day.

Working in groups is a lot more beneficial than working alone because people can get things done more faster, make new friends, and more fun. i really hope our teachers can give us more opportunities to work in groups than to work and do everything alone because it really help a lot of people to become social and more independent and to develop themselves.

"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas.

This is reasonable for each individual, and people should make their own decisions in life. We always ran into problems and sometimes we need to make decisions on our own.

When we have the choice and decide to make the differences, it's important to follow our instincts and we have to take the responsibility to make the good choice. This is how we learn by ourselves.

In our daily life, people always ran into problems and get stressed out, for example, the car broke down in the middle of the traffic, failing the test that you've been studying for weeks, your boss fired me today...

However, it is our choice to make the right decision and to change it; you could call for help from someone, you can study harder or ask others to help on the school work, and also look into other jobs that you are interested in.

There are so many options for everyone to pick and to follow our own instincts and ideas to make everything better.

As an adult, soon after high school I will be joining navy and have my own life, to do everything by myself.

Everything around me will change completely,I will not have my parents standing beside me to teach me common sense, nor my teachers to teach me about life lessons, nor any of my friends to be there and help me out, this is all about me and my decision to make.

If I'm going to learn the hard way, I will have to learn the hard way.

Maybe my instincts kick in and help me out, you never know.

Making your own judgment is one of the most important survival skills we will have to learn in life, everyone will grow up one day, to have your own family and all the responsibilities, now you are the one who have to decide everything, to have responsibility for not only yourself but you family as well.

Instincts will tell you which way your heart goes, and sometimes it might leads you to the wrong path, but don't worry, this is how we are going to learn.

Success is not an easy path, it's full of adventure and false on the way to finish.

You will experience more fail than you can ever imagine before you achieve the goal, to success it all by yourself is to follow your instincts and ideas.

You may have concerns that what if you seek guidance for experts and authorities about life's important matters?

Guess what, life is full of adventure, you never going to know what is coming next and not everyone's life is going to be the same, so therefore seek guidance for experts may work for some people, not all, you may have found a different solution for yourself.

All we can do is listen what others advises are, Because you will be the one who make the final decision, and you are responsible to your decision, not anybody's advice or common.

Everything is on you and to follow your heart to make things right, or to learn how to judge then choose the right path.

No one will change your life unless you let it happen, no one can change your final decision unless you don't follow your instincts and heart.

This is why we should make our own decisions, not only to make things right, but also follow your heart and to understand about life's important matters.",human
"I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you haven't done before. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success.

On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life.

When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. You should always be happy about trying new things. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. Giving up ruins your life.

In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it can help us in life and in the future.",human
"some societies, think that letting students select classes to guide them towards a specific career it is a good idea.

the classes they select may help them prepare for the career their are thinking to study in college.

the classes they select to take while they study in high school it can be useful for them to guide them in different careers;however,they may drop out of the classes they are not interested studying and drop in the ones they prefer to study to be prepared for they'r future career.

this classes are a good way to teach students different careers that they may like to study in their future for example engineering,plumbing, or any other higher education, another reason why letting students take classes that guide them for a future career is that by the time they reach college they will know a little about the career they choose to study.

some students that had been guided in their high school are in a higher chance to graduate in that career.

by the time they have graduate college thy'll be ready for the job they choose to work on in conclusion this program it's useful for all students in high school to help them get prepared for the career they choose to take.",human

"Students should enjoy summer break, cause they would not have to worry about school and they can get to relax some educators should not complain about summer break being too long cause having a long break is better than to go to school cause school you have to do work and do tests. but in during the summer break you get to relax all day summer is the time to hangout with your friends and famiy and to go to vacation to enjoy life too and not think about school or work that is what summer is all about and for educators saying that students are not going to remember what they learned in school. from last year when they come back to school is not true cause some people remember what they learned last year and some don't and i don't think summer break should be 3 to 4 weeks cause most of time students are in school more than they get to have a long break. i think summer break should be for 2 months so people can have a break from school cause i know how school can be stressful for students cause they have to worry about a lot of things passing their classes passing their sols that gets stressful to students. cause that is the most important things in school i think for winter break has to be 2 weeks cause of chrimstmas and new years that time is too enjoy those 2 holidays with your family and then come back to school in january. for spring break should always be in March not in April cause it has always been spring break in March spring break should be 2 weeks to take a break from school and to come back in school with a fresh mind to get ready to go to school and learn. so the students can be prepared the only break in fall is thankgiving which is only a week that seems fair cause is just the 2nd holiday in November having breaks is always a good thing i don't know why some people hate it it gets you time to think about things it helps people a lot to relive stress on people it makes people happy and puts a smile on people's faces and that is all i have to say about all the breaks for the seasons.

"If you ask people ""When are you feel happy?"". Most of them can respond that they feel happy in some kind when they are succesful, with a less of problems and failures. But what are in the another side of this success? How people get this success? Nobody can't tell whole way of getting succesful. But why?

Everyone went a hard, full of pitfall way. It wasn't easy, it was hard when you tried to achieve one's goal. Succesful people hadn't easy way of getting succesful. Failure is in some kind examination, challenge for us when we are trying to stay succesful. Succesful people must pass all kind of failure examination that to show that they are strong, sturdy, and patient. Success doesn't like weak and whiner people.

For example, famous people like musicians and composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven; writers like Shakespeare, Stendal, Tolstoy, and Pushkin; scientics like Einshtein and Tesla. They all are famous now, because in their time they had goal: be succesful and do those things that they are like to do by their soul and heart. They had failures and opponents, peoples who just only hate and envy them. And now you're just can only imagine on how much those people were full of enthusiasm and pation that we know about them now, in our time. They are examples of succesful people for us now.

Nobody of famous and succesful people don't tell you that it was easy way of stay succesful. Because it is true. And everyone has different failures; you can't feel those failures like feels those person by itself. And nobody can't tell you that the way to stay success will be easy. It is a very big number of people, who pray to achieve their goal, but with the first failures they just stopped and go back, they loss their enthusiasm. And this people just need to be pushed with someone with the words ""Hey! What's happen? This is all all that you can show? Other people have more failures then you, you must go forward! You mustn't to be afraid to see with your eyes your failure. You must be strong."" And I think they can find some strength.

There are a lot of different meetings, conferences, and seminars with a succesful and famous in some way people. There you can hear more good things that can help you to improve, to achieve your goal and stay succesful. But you can't hear all of the failure that would be connected personaly with you, and on how much it can be hard, that you still have enthusiasm that help you to solve your problems and improve. When you stay on the way to achieve your goal, because of the failures you can forget why you do all this things, you need to remember all of the good things you now that will be when you achieve your goal and stay, at first, success for yourself. With a failures you stay more self-controlled, and grew up more inside of you, stay more confident in your deed.

In our life we stay succesful with everyday for ourself too. We have some small and big goals that we want to achieve. Our life is the way to stay succesful. We are achieve our goals for stay succesful in the school, in the college or university, in the sport, and on the work.

To stay succesful it is not easy way with a failures that pursuit us. But we need remember for what we stay on this way, way to stay succesful.",human
"Do you think students would benefit from being attend classes from home? As you might students can do well working from home, or they can attend classes from school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help,or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need some times help for the teacher. In conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because they can cheat on. For example, Generic_Name is working on geometry and she don't know how to do parallels, the only way that she can work on it, is cheating, she can take out her phone and search the answer from the internet. In conclusion, students would not benefit to attend classes from home because they can cheat on it and not learn how to do their works by their self without internet.

Some people argue, the students need some extra help. This is true because students with 18 years old they want to left the school for help their family even if they don't want to left the school they have for work and get some money. students would benefit from being attend classes from home by way of online because they want to finish the school. however, the students need to work hard for help their family and finish the schools for a job more better and get more money.

That there are better thinkings people can do you best lets say that I lost against this guy on a game really can't be mad at the same time because you to show respect not get mad at the same time so at the same time you got now more about the other person people.

"Acutely yes, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. because if you are just idle you're not get anything done in your whole life and just sitting idle it's not going to help you see what you acutely need for your life, or your family life, or if you don't have a family think about your future.

They are people who don't have the life as you do. they wish and dream to have a better life to do what they want to do the things they wish to but you already have a live and everything you need in your life so dream big and make it come true. don't just sit idle and do nothing

Think about what you going to do. like some students say that they just want to be a famous ,if you want to a famous or important you better do something in your life, the other famous people did something they weren't idle in fact they spend their time just to tell us to do something in our life. like if you want to be a doctor you have to study for your dreams to be what ever you wanted to be. being a idle it's not going tho help you you life depends on you and your ideas. if you have dreams

Life needs energy to do something imagine you have a good ideas about doing a project in engineering and you designed really impressive, and the teacher like it and you entered the engineering science.

years later you found a good job in your career and you you have money, that make everyone proud about what you just did in your life and your family are thankful to you.

Life needs you and your ideas to prove yourself don't sit and do nothing and wast your time playing around

. because if you are just idle and doing nothing that doesn't make any since you have to do what ever you want to do it's your life no noes life your own life fight for it and go crazy for if and never give up says I con't do this and it's possible yes you can. trust yourself and ideas that's make your life easier to you.

"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone.

Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it.

The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity it's more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you don't know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do.

Another reason, why working with someone's else it's better. Sometimes student don't like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students don't really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and don't let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher.

Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because it's fun. Working in a group it's more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. It's always nice meeting new people and getting to know them. And if they are from different country or different culture. It is clear for me i would work with a group than working alone.",human
"The best way to spend your time outside is going to outside in your backyard and going out for a walk. People would enjoy and want to do them because there are many advantages doing these activites.

When you go outside in your backyard you can have family over and do many activites for example you can plant a garden with your family and get very messy and mudy but still make your backyard look very nice. Other activites you can do is play soccer, have a water ballon fight with family, play in your pool, play football, and play with your pets if you have any. This list can go on and on but I will stop here for now. Lets just say there are so many activites to do in your backyard.

The best part of going outside is inviting your family over and take a walk,ride your bike, and walk to the park. The advantages of taking a walk is similar to being outside in your backyard. The only differences is your walkng and your children fall asleep a lot faster. These two activites have many things in common. One of a example that these two activites have in common is you get to spend time with your family and pets. Who wouldn't want to spend time with their family or pets if you have any.

There are many fun activites that you can do when you want to be outside but these personally are my favorite activites because I get to spend time with family. Who wouldn't want to do these two activites. These are reason why people would enjoy doing these activites.",human
"I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected.

First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like.

Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career.

Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money.

In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help.              ",human

"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, i'll be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something.

First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends.

Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it.

It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day?

In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

"Generic_Name

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.

Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.

Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.

It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"".

I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.

Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.

Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.

So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.

Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",human
"Have you ever thought about how many people are ""success by going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm?."" This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge.

Once

I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what

I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so

I will never give up for any reason.

This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life

I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake you're wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle.

Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others.

On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say

I can use it to improve my self.

To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way. Failure give knowledge and a better change to improve yoursel. ",human
"First of all technology has helped people in many ways to do various sort of things when people are in need of something. When technology was first introduced many people didnt know how it could be used to help save lives or help build buldings,schools,malls everything that we have today is because of how benefical technology is to us. The lack of human contact is not using technology too, much its by the person who chooses to use his or hers cellphone, computer and television while technology takes a important positive impact in peoples lives it also helps save peoples lives. For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution.

However people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we can't go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology.

The way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me.

"No,I don't think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework.

You can't even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day,they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired.

Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it it's likely students won't get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students can't graduate from high school.

To rap this up I say that the main reason why I don't think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.",human
"In the modern times kids want to stay out late until 2-3 in the morning, but it is not safe for kids to be staying out that late. Especially, teenagers now days get more in trouble late at night because they do illeagal things. often times teens go to parties and drink underage which is bad for their health. usually, curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because, if there was no curfew teens would stay out late, do illeagel stuff ,and get them self in deep trouble.

Teenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they don't follow the curfew. It is dangerous for teens to stay out late because the world we live in now is not as safe as we think it is. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew. If they want to go out somewhere past the curfew then they always have a choise to go with their parents. Usually, most teens don't have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger.

If teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law. They can get in a lot of trouble from their parents and the police for breaking the law. Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. Another example why teenagers shouldn't be out after curfew is because, most teenagers when they go to paties they smoke which is really bad for their health. The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep.

Now days teenagers don't spent so much time with their parents. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Staying after curfew would definetly keep teenagers out of danger and trouble. Teens can aslo have extra time to their homework. It is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew for their own safety.

All the reasons that are above is only because, so it shows what would happen if the teens don't follow the curfew. If the city council wants to keep the kids safe, healthy, and out of danger they should definetly have the curfew. The best way to keep the kids safe is to make them follow the curfew for their own safety. The curfew is there for the protection of the teenagers.",human
"Always positive thorough It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life this is good statement because we need motivate to the people with problems. For example If you have problems on your work the key is talk with the person is the problem and your manager on good attitude but if you don't have good attitude the problem is going to be worst.

One reason is when we go to the work and motivate to team they can have best personality positive influence for a good work together and talk everybody ,but somebody team work have bad attitude the team work is not good for work because a group discussion needs a few talkative people and can make good humor with your team work

Another reason is motivate yourself have good attitude everywhere and always If you have always good attitude you are felling; your attitude shows who you are is the profile a representation and that identical one that is you the socialism it's importance for

""My social life"". On the social we can share the attitude, ideas . For example If your teacher not had a good attitude you can help and talk with him and know why he has that attitude.

"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they don't treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that it's a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer.

My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I don't feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really don't want to leave them (the people here are great).

In some reasons the people don't treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didn't like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didn't want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didn't even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didn't tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun.

The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they can't control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he can't control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem.

Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people don't always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thankyou for hearing me today!!

Have a great day!!",human
"I say no becuase you cannot jude somonw by there first impressions has a person. It would be nice getting to know the person and if their imature its fine from first impressions. Getting to know who the person is by askin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. For a example if someone is tired and your gunna be like oh their lazy you cant just base them from there firsr impresstions.

Is it impossible to change no its not impposble because it i ur mentality. In life nothing is inpossible you can easily chnage to a whole diffrent lets say, your a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me i was very quiet i would never wanna go talk to poeple because i was really shy with people but now i like to talking to everyone else and i dont care who the person is i always introduce my self.

So i strongly agree with this statement you cannot jude someone by their first impressions some people thought i was really mean when they first met me bcause i would be tired end of the day and i wouldnt walk people because i was lazy and i didnt have that enery to talk. Thats why i changed my mentality so people would not call me lazy because its anoying so thats why i changed my whole life around i didnt wanna be so the same so i just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new life style.

When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they dont belive in them selfs that they can change has a new perosn i didnt think i was going to be a whole new diffrent person. and now i do really like who i am always smileing. Back then i would not like to smile i was a really boring person. I wont lie i have based poeple have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it.

They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that's is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn form it. Want to be the best you will have to learn whats the best from your mistake's.",human
"Technology has given us humans positive and negavtive effects in life. For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more. So human contact can be limited now days but there isn't any change becaue more and more techonlogy keeps coming towards our way and we can't stop it.

In conclusion this is what I think about technology ive given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact.",human
"Does the success consist of going through failure?

Yes, I am agree with this quote.

As we all know been successful is not easy. Some people say that hard things make hard soldiers; Therefore, failure is part of the success, but that does not make it easy for us; Why? Because no one likes the idea of suffer in order to be successful in life. As a matter of facts; Failure help us to become who we really want to be or who we are suppose to be, but no all of us get the chance to feel successful or not even see any progress; yet some people choose to give up, instead of fight for a better life; A life with success. But do we loss enthusiasm during our way to success? yes we do!

It is OK to loss enthusiasm in our way to success; that is showing every body else, and you as well that we are humans, and we can get tire sometimes; But what is not OK is to give up, because you will showing everybody that you are weak.

By showing us how difficult life can get, and tough us that you are the only one who choose to continue or to give up in your life; Oprah Winfred would be a great overcoming example. Oprah had suffer a lot since she was a child; yet she decided to continue with her life. Even though it was not easy to act like nothing happened, but she knew what king of person she wanted to be. Therefore, she decided to fight for those things she always wanted; instead of been crying all her life. Do not doubt that the sky is the limit even for the suffering. Oprah was a determinate woman; a woman who wanted to be successful. Yet everybody else was saying that she would not be able to accomplish what she wanted; instead of supporting her they were feeling sorry for her, and not doing anything. Therefore, she became more stronger than she had ever been, and now she is showing as that even after everything she has been through you can smile with placer and success.

On the other hand we have immigrants; those people who fight day by day to get no even what they want, but what they need. As an immigrant; success is the biggest word we all are working to accomplish, some people do not even believe they can accomplish more than what they have accomplished already; Even though everything we have accomplished until this day is because of failure; because each morning we decided to go out a fight to get something else than just failure. Eugenio Dervez is an example of overcoming in a different country, language, and culture. He is an inspire person for immigrant people in the USA. Eugenio has been proving us that dreams can come true. He showed us that everything is possible, you just need to believe in yourself, and trust that you are capable of so much more. Even though some people could be selfish even in your own family; Instead of been worry about others opinion worry about your future; so one day you can be successful, too.

Finally, in my experience I have fail so many times; but I am sure that any of those times I have fail will not stop me from what I want to do or who I want to be. Somehow my family does not have faith in me; and even though that if I fail I have no one to support me; I am afraid. However I know that I am capable of so much more, and I will fight until the end of this. Also, I always wanted to show everyone that they were wrong about me that I am capable as everyone else. Yet everybody was judging me, I decided to teach myself how do become a better version of me. I will continue fighting for myself. As you should do!

In conclusion, in order to success we have to go from failure to failure. As I was said before; there are so many people that have been showing us that everything is possible. Instead of been afraid for our mistakes we need to learn from them, so we can success in our life. Therefore, we have to think about the future that we want and start working on it, so we can be the people we want to be; the people our parents want us to be. By fighting this battles day by day we are not just creating a better country for ourselves, but a better country for our families. Remember that hard battles make hard soldiers.                                                                                                              ",human
"Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different.   ",human
"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.

Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.

When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.

I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.

In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.           ",human
"We need the to stay active to accomplish the important matters people need to work on and being inactivity the amount of energy people spend in the day means that sleep is the best way to go for. Being active has a grate purse in life. When people are active and awake, there aware of the surroundings. People wake up from the night sleep they had and having breakfast, getting ready for work, or heading out to the gym. But inactivity is a good too. In the of the day people sleep in the night or morning. Also many people need some rest to keep the same energy they had yesterday in the morning or night.

The best part when someone or yourself is active they can accomplish so many things. Having the good energy you can finish the work that is needed to be done at work or at home. Feeling about yourself of finishing your work or task is the bets feeling ever. There also many thing to do beside work, walk around the park, have an outing with your friend, even finish reading the book that you like. At the end of the day all what you need to do is go to sleep for the next day. To have the same energy you just need some rest let the body relax to get the same energy, just like batter of your phone when charging.

Having a good night rest is good for the body, your body needs the energy to work and have a good system. When you don't have rest the body is slow, you're moody. Also not focused on the things your doing. Sometimes you can't finish thing on time cause the brain is needs to rest so you can focus on your work. It's dangerous if your out driving in the night, pull the car over rest a little a bite before heading the road. You can forget things much more faster too form the lack of rest the brain has.

"I'm agree to take guides about careers because, I think that the students include to me, we want to have a spacific career guide when, we enter to high school because when we will go to collage, we have to be prepared with ideas, how is the career that we want to take and the students has to be ready with knowlegde with his own careers.

The first reason, I say that because the students will be more excite to came to the school, they will say, I like to go to shool beacuse, I practice somenthing that I love. I think that the schools need to change to give the student to choose, what they want know, I not talking about the classes, I talking about careers guides. I know we have young age but we want to be something our life, we have the goals to work in something, we love. The school's need give the opportunity to prepare the students. If the school's have guide careers or activities of work the students, they will enjoy that.

The seconds reasons is personal but, I see that almost the all people of my country when they come here and they have the opportunity to study but, when they end from the high school they stay in the same thing working in not good jobs earning 14 dollars per hours and some people say now that the diploma from high school is nothing to their. Some people go to school beacuse it's something ilegal, if they not going, I think they will put more interest to the study if they have the opportunity to study what they want to be when they are more olders. This are examples from others people too.

The students dreams that the school have something similar from college.

Some people tell me that when I end from high school, I will work in the same jobs, maybe I think the same because my family don't have the money but if the school's have something of academic's to know about the jobs, maybe the academic is not free but, is more cheeper than college or the school's have something that we can know about the jobs. Maybe the all student is not rich's but the only thing they want is work what they want.

Everyone enjoy doing the thing what they love with the heart.

I lucky to be in this school because the school give the opportunity to some students go to tech. That's what I know about the guide careers, the student want knowlegde from when they're in high chool.",human
"When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

No matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around. Some of these things will teach you lessons, maybe you did the wrong thing but you'll be wiser and know better. Everyone goes through something, tough problems can happen to anyone you just need to keep your head up and do what is right.",human
"Should we accomplish more if we are always doing something. People who work's will get us new technology like, car's radio , TV. If people that don't work on something they will not get technology as fast as we can. Technology need to be work on and improve them. Technology that can give job's and give people a way of living. If more people are doing something it will change how we live improve life's and give change around the world. The thing's that change over time are computer, TV and radio. We used these items a day by day base's.

If are to accomplish more if we always doing something like the radio. The radio was one of big step's on time. the people that work on the radio when came out was hard for them to get the right setting. That was the big accomplish for the worker and it was poplar when it came out to the people. In the time radio grow and improve because of people are accomplish more of the work to improve them self. That led us to getting to the first TV it was a big thing doing that time. the people that have the determine's to work on the radio that led us to improve the internment job's it give more a working job's.

The first TV was a big thing it was able give sound unlike the movie that time and ti give people something to see on the screen. That got people to work for them and there determine to get one TV was high. People will work harder to active more of what they what. People that work on TV have a determine to improve what they got. It was first time the elections was on TV that everyone that had a TV could which it see who are they voting for. The people that work more on the TV are determine to get the TV to work and get to people to buy there good's this will lead to computers.

The first computers was made with no sound it was a computers with programming on it thy used it as a basic. the people who what to improve them to have the idea to give more people to buy the the computer.

"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.

I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.

Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.

Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself

""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.

In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.",human
"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.

Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase that's what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.

Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.

Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.",human
"In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work.

Preparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your ""GPA"" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldn't get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick.

Another reason, on which it's good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sol's that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldn't wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we could've be with our sister because we wouldv'e been out at 1:30pm.

My last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings.

In conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals. ",human
"Technology

Technology does not effect the way how people interact with another. Think about it like this, some people might just make some type of contact with another person and at the same time doing other things such as in checking your information, money status, savings, and many other things more, yet still making human contact with another. yes i think think for some a occasions it would be necessary and and really nice to make eye contact and interact with one another, for example when you are at a job interview, or even being the job interviewer. Little things like that i would consider to interact with another. There's many other things that would be important to interact with, especaily if it has to do with yourself. Technology itself is good hepler now in days. It can help you with anything that you are in need of, thats why i say it's more of a negative and positive for obvious reasons.

Technology does not effect people, or the way they are getting taught. Teachnology is something good for us, helps us keep things more in order, or can hold more information insted of having paper copys all over the place. technology can be a other way of interacting with other people for example like making a phone call, or a text, or even a video call those are other ways of making contact with one another. thats why for those reasons technology isn't making an effect on us as much.

Technology, so this where it could effect us. Well one it could effect if the perosn doesn't know how to multitask. Two if can effect you for example with your learning. Three it's going to be hard for you to listen and to keep up with who you would be talking to. lets just say you apply for job and your stuck on phone texting others about other job opportunity and your interveiwer send out your job interveiw date and because you were stuck on your phone you miss your job interview. that would suck. for those reasons technology would effect.

Technology itself is good and bad because there's many good things that you can do, but there's other things that you could miss. yes they both work good making or not making interactions with or without technology, but i rather have more human contact just because i rather not miss anything.

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.",human
"In my opinion, i think what Albert Einstein is saying, might be true. I think imagination is like a little world in your mind that only you can control. Imagination is what you want it to be, nobody can control it because it's yours to keep and think about in your mind. I agree with Albert Einstein's quote,""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with this quote because, knowledge is building up in your mind little by little because people are teaching it to you.

Even though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to ""look"" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much.

Albert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\space stuff. Imagination is a real thing. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do.

Life is full of bad people. If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to ""think before you act."" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, you're going to get in trouble. What if bad people that are in jail right now, would've thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act.

You might also want to ""imagine"" what would happen to you in the future if you did something wrong. Another good reason is to learn from your mistakes. Since you already did them you're have a good visual of what you might expect to happen to you in the future if you did something wrong without thinking about it. you might also want to have knowledge because if you thought of the consequences and or imagined them, you wouldnt of done it in the first place.",human
"Successes comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.

When you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.

I try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.",human
"Conserving energy and resources should not mean that children should go to school for only four day and 2 hours. Children are not going to be able to process what there laurning. Some children cant benefit from this. There are tomay people that need more help then others. People need the benefit of more school day. School is inportent to many people. We need them school day.

Conserving energy is a good thing for people but children need time for school, with not that much time for school we are going to have a lot of people failing or droping out. Children like school because out side of school, they dont have nothing and school is the way out of having nothing but they make the best of it. Them people that dont have notheing make something out thim safes from school like sports. People that play sports need school too. How are they going to play if there grads are bad or they need to stay after school to practs. They need it more because there trying to reach to the NFL and not that much people can do it. Poeple are just trying to make it throw or other people that just dont care.

Two hours, you are not going to laurn nothing, time is most inportant to many people. People will need more then 2 hours. Teachers most inportint need more time to work. Theres not even going to get payed will they need more time. How are they going to pay there bills. People need to under stand that people have inpront thing to pay. People need to thank about other people not just them selfs.

Time people need it,but we need more, we dont need less. Poeple are happy how they are right know. The time is most inportent to people. Conserving energy and reources are very inportent but just to go to school just four day and two hours i dont beleave its that inportent.",human
"The positive attitude is the key to success in the life, because a person with good attitude good energy always is accepted, a person with positive attitude always is happy, because they believe thta everything is possible, that people with good energy they trasmite good energy to everyone around they, the positive attitude os the key to success in here reasons why: More effective in the job,

better relationship with family and friends and good life in general.

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.

A person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time.

My mom always say Believe in God and be positive.

After the rain the calm come. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude.

The positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. In the life that people have to show the better face and smile and say everything is possible,but no only said, that people have to believe that. All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change.

sometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.

If a person dont have positive attitude that person always is going to do everything wrong, because if a person dont believe in herself nobody can do it.",human
"People use to say that working make better life. In now days people who are self-reliance define as they need people to follow their instincts or ideas and their is also people who are usually follow their own ideas. Both of them are working ways that are preferred to people, But I think that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters, Because it will make their life easier and help people who are having troubles in their life. There are a lot of thing that we cloud talk about people asking help from expert,But I got two of the story that I want to talk about and made peoples life easier.

The first example is a true story that happened to me when I was young. It was a summer in 2010, I was in a summer camp for basketball at Generic_City, It was the first practices day and I was so happy, Because I could finally start to have real training for basketball. At that time I was in a private school that have no sports, So the only way that I cloud play sport is going to camp in summer time. Well that day at middle of the practice I hurt my ankle because of my teammate so I had to stay in hospital. In hospital I thought that I will not able to play sport anymore so I was really upset about it, When I was thinking about that, My father told me that life is easy and hard some time and life will never follow the step that people go, so they have to be stronger to be able to control their own life so they will not follow the step that other people went, After my father told me that I start to realize that life ain't easy so I have to be way more stronger than before so I could be better me in future and it happened now, So that is the reason that I think with others help peoples life will be way easier than before.

The second example is a story that my mother told me when I was a child. It is a story about a young man trying to make a hammer. It was a winter in long time ago, there was a young man that live in a really old house, At one day he was trying to make a hammer so that will help him to make a new house. So he traveled a lot of place to find a perfect iron for that hammer, In the way to find perfect iron he found so many iron that's not perfect in his eyes. But in one day he found a old man that are making a hammer, when young man came close to old man he found out that is the perfect iron that his finding all day long so he asked old man how did he found the iron, After old man heard what he said he laughed and said"" young man in this world nothing is perfect if you trying to make a hammer like me you have to make everything equally, And nothing is perfect on lest you treat them perfect."" After old man told everything to young man he realized that the iron that he think is not perfect is perfect if he treated is nicely and in the end he made a normal hammer that could really help him in the future. After my mother told me this story I realized that with older help you will know a lot of things that you never knew before, And this is the second reason that I think that with experts help your life will be better and you will learn a lot of life's matter than before.

Some people often think that they will decide everything by their self, And there are some people are seek guidance from experts and authorities. But I think that people should ask form expert and authorities help, Because it will make people's life easier and help people who are having trouble in there life. There are a lot of expert that helped me a lot, And I think that it will help all the people who is having trouble in their life.",human
"when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone.",human
"According to Ralph Waldo Emerson, so I am here to support the motion which says....''

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplish''

. Before going to the point,I will like to let you know the meaning of accomplish

.ACCOMPLISH IS WHAT YOU FULFILL,

leaving your real life in this world will surely makes you accomplish or fulfill what you want in this life. For instances; I have seen a girl leaving a fake life to accomplish what see want, but at the end of the day she was caught, their is a company who need someone who is rich and popular to be the director of the company and will be paid thousand of dollars every week. This lady try to live a fake life and decided to go for the post, when she got there every single person believes that she is rich and famous,and she has to compete with other lady who doesn't lives a fake life. she is so poor but have the work experience and was talented,after some days,weeks and month. It now the time to choose the leader,they both seat separately with their heart beating vastly,the lady living a fake life have the 100% assurance that she will wi the contest, here comes the judges to call our the winner,the speaker gives a speech about each of them. The speech goes as; After we have camp both ladies for some month will we sure;y choose the leaders but here with me some evidence about those ladies,their is girl among you two who lives a fake life to get what she want and there is another girl who didnt do that, this position is given to the girl who does not leave the fake live because if this position is given to you who live fake life you will surely ruin this company by embezzled and faking this company,the speaker says she borrowed almost $500,000 from banks,two house and 3 brand new cars to fake her life and at the end she did not accomplish what she want,likewise the other girl who be herself in this world and finally fulfill her dream and have greatest accomplishment.

With this little words of mine i will like to convinced not to confused you that living your real life in this live that is constantly trying to male you something else is the greatest accomplish but if you try and fake your life in this world you will never accomplish anything than public disgrace if you later got caught.",human
"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even it's a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasn't made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasn't going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasn't going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time.

Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people!

Some people don't buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents aren't like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, that's why some parents don't let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they don't care whats happens around them. Like my parents didn't want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didn't even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didn't have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they don't have money to eat and they can't help out their children with their eduaction.

In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people don't speak your language you'll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that don't live with you.       ",human
"Everyone would eventually ask an advice if they need help on a particular subject or ask for an opinion if they ever get confuse. Advises or opinions would solve one's problem. For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.",human
"I think for my opinion students should and shouldn't use their phones at school. because the good thing about it is faster and its easier because students now days use their phones every day. The bad things about students using their phones in class its that it could be a distraction for them doing their work and many more things.

The bad things about students using their phones are that students wouldn't pay attention in class and would be lazy to do their work at school, thats why the schools have computers and a library's so we could look up information for their subjects. Its a distraction and wouldn't let them learn or do their work. cause now in these days all teenagers use their phone for everything. Lets say if the teacher let the students use their phone so they can look up information for their work. Im pretty sure mostly of the students would be doing something is like being on social media or texting their friends. Thats why school is a place to get your education by learning and paying attention.

Even students now this days they get mad if the teacher ask for their phone cause they use it allot in class. Students learn more faster by reading n doing their work and using their head. Cause if they use their phone they going to be looking up the answers. I think what should teachers do is that they should give their phone to the teacher once you get into class and once the class ends he should give it to you back. Another bad things about phones is that they use them on the test to look up the answers n dont try.

The good things about using your phones is that it easier to use then a computer and it so much faster. I think students should be allowed cause you could learn from their n look up information or things that you dont understand in class and you could find another way of learning and different ideas. The other good reason your better on typing on phone then using computer.

I think its a good and a bad idea cause with your phone its quicker to use then a computer but the bad thing about its a distraction to student. Cause they would putting more attention to their instead of the teacher. And student get distract with their phone cause they access to social media at the same time. And student would cheating on test cause they would be looking up the answers. Students now in this days have to use their phones less cause they use them every day n not their and thats the reason they dont learn.",human
"Small acts of kindness can come for yourself and others. for example when you see someone that is siting alone at lunch you should invite them to sit white you. like this one time my fried and I were siting at a tad at lunch, then we sow a boy siting alone at a tad. So we desisted to ask him if he wanted to sit withe us and he side ""alright I wold love to."" after that we found out we have simpler classes as him. We all became good friends and weer still friends to this day so an act of kindness can make a friendship.

Moving to a new school can be herd. Because your living your friends that you had for a way you can make the new kid feel confab in school, by showing then were their classes are explaining some thing they don't understand and asking hem to sit with you at lunch and you and can help each other with homework you don't get. And show their around town and make them feel like there wanted in school, and you can show he or she the clubs after school and if you to have similarity showing some one you care makes them feel like their going to be okay at their new school and will proudly makes them feel more confident.

A nether way of showing an act of kindness is by listing to peoples and friends. pronouns beaus some times you fell down and have no one to talk to,so you can be that some one, listen, give advise and confert you have to let then know your their for them.

"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". We tend to persevere when we are used to doing something for a long time but if you don't do anything how will u accomplish and persevere in anything? However been idle doesn't necessarily mean we are incapable of persevering forward, it just means that we lack the spirit to accomplish our goals or dreams. Your inactivity in life doesn't serve a purpose at all in your life instead it serves as your downfall and your weakness in persevering.

People who persevere to accomplish their goals or dreams always end up changing their lives for the better instead of the worst. Like Lionel Messi he didn't give up on his dreams to become a world star athlete because he couldn't walk upright and was always bending over, he continued playing despite been different from everyone else he played with. He played and showed how energetic he was in accomplishing his dream of becoming a world class soccer player. And today he's one of the world's Best and richest soccer players in the world today. He showed that even if you have tried and can't persevere through your goals or dreams, the little effort you put in can do a drastic change in your life. It's amazing to see how much we have done in te last two hundred years pertaining to technology. We didn't do all that by standing around and been idle but by always pesevering to accomplis something greater for ourselves and our society and to move forward. we have created electricity, telephones, telegraph, airplane, motorcycle, automobile and more. we created so much that it pushes us forward to be better people. But the most important one we discovered was electricity because more than half of what we use today uses some form of electricity.

We have created so much that people would not be idle but there are still idle people. Not everyone who perseveres comes from a poor family or had a terrible life when they were little or was disabled, people can persevere where ever they are from. They can persevere even if they look, talk or act different from everyone else as long as they have a strong spirit and a strong will to move ahead and be a better person than they were before nothing can stop them. So let us all be persevering and be able to accomplish our goals by doing somthing good for ourselves.",human
"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays.

When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a 'new friend,' to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media.

In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge.

Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. It's true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what it's true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and it's neccessary to learn how to manage them.

A solution for this problem could be in the parents' hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kid's future.

After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, it's important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldn't let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more. ",human
"I believe, what Thomas Jefferson wrote about "" determine never to be elder ""

because we would never know how can we impact on someone life or in our life.

never say never , don't stop doing what you love, just because some people won't appreciated your work. Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someone's life, and even you never give up, just do you and you will see the result at the end.

First of all, I'ts amazing how much may be done if you always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking to much don't wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain don't feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because he's girlfriend didn't want to with him, for the fact that he only thing he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree.

In addition, this is why don't stop doing something. Who knows probably a girl/ guy could fall in love with you, or you could also make people feel strong for whatever situation you could be you will see the result at the end. Keep doing what the people with illness do, never give up, they always have an smile on their face. Even people famous they kill their self because they feel alone, because they don't interact with the community, or with fun people that could make their life happy and easier.

In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote. Personally I don't waste time, I keep doing me, I am always doing something for example, school , work and I also play soccer for the Generic_City recreation soccer. My advice for you is that if you don't something similar of what happen with my cousin, take care of your self, keep yourself busy as much as you can.                   ",human
"I disagree about what the principal has decide because some student don't like sports or any other activities at school. They are probably don't do that activities because they don't know how to play or do those activities and some activities you have to buy all the things that you need for that activities but they don't have money to buy all the stuff.

Other people might fortgot to give the paper that they need for the sports or any kinda of activities and they cant go or play sports just because of that reason and some people dont do a sports because other student will judges them because they might be bad at playing that sports and they will judges them.

Other student played sports but scared to play now because she or he might got hurt when he played last time and she or he might got scared because of that reason and people will call him or her weak just because she or he fell or got hurt.

Not everyone are good at playing sports and even though they probably know how to play sports they might just be scared to play because they have shyness and people are lazy to do any kind of sports.

Not all of the student will follow the principal just because they dont probably know how to play the sports and they are shy to play when people are yeling and staring at them. Not everyone will do the sports just because the principal told them to do any other sports. People will just ignore the principal

They will get mad because if they have low grades they will get kick out of the team just because of the low grades. Other student aren't that good at doing sports but they will probably do better but they are scared to play sports because they see alot of the people who get hurt just because of a sports they dont want to get hurt because of a sports.

Some student will not do what the principal say because it's either they dont how to play the sports or they dont wanna play the sports and if they do play sports it's because they got force to play the sports because their parents and they dont want their parents to be mad or sad because they do sports.

Some people are scared because of a sports they might get hurt because of that sports.

They watch TV at home and it show how the people who play sports get hurt by playing sports and they are scared when people are staring at them.

Some people don't want to do the work for the year book because its boring and some people hates doing books stuff because it's boring and they hate books and some people don't like when they read books.

They do'nt want to do any other activities because it's not their type or they just hate doing all the stuffs. they are probably lazy to do that stuff at school and they just hate doing all that's stuff.       ",human
"Hi, my name is Generic_Name. I heard that you are accepting people to come look at some businesses they prefer, and learn more about what they are interested in. One thing I'm interested in knowing is, How many people do you let come and experience this opportunity ? I strongly feel like it would be a pleasure to be able to come and see the environment or being able to understand the right and wrong ways of teaching kids. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible.

I feel like being a well rounded person is a good character trait everyone should have. I could demonstrate that in many ways. You are probably thinking, ""Generic_Name, everyone can be a well rounded person in their own ways"". Thing is, people can't compare themselves to me. I

have qualities that others may lack in, such as: speaking 2 languages, understanding kids, and being about to tolerate the kids. Speaking 2 languages is great. For example, if I have a Spanish student in my class, I'd be able to have a conversation with him and make him/her feel comfortable. Also, showing that you are interest in the job and showing that you want is good to show. You want to be able to show people that you are qualified for it.

Respect is another thing I will always have with me. I will show the kind of respect to my parents, to anyone else out there, whether is be my boss, coworkers, students, or their parents. Showing lack of respect can kick you out of your job. Being respectful will show others that you are serious about getting the job. Referring back to what I said about lack of respect, an example of that can be: coming to work and being in a grumpy mood and telling people mean things can get you to lose your job. That's why I think it's always right to be in the best attitude you could possibly be in no matter what you are going on outside of work.

The amount of responsibilities I will receive is no match for me. In other words, If you hand me 2 stacks of paper and give me 2 days to fill it out, I will. Giving me orders is another thing that i would follow, even if I don't want to do it. If I had a chance to work with kindergartners, the ones that struggle and are not comprehending what is being taught. I would stay after school with them for as long as they need until they understand and can accomplish what they didn't get in the beginning. I will always go out of my way in trying to help kids understand the material they need. Another thing is, grading homework and making sure they get it back. I feel like most teachers lack in making sure they grade their students test and not returning it on time. I would make it a priority to make sure it gets done.

In conclusion, I think I would be a great person to hire. Seeing and meeting people will improve my knowledge and how to work with others. I will get a be able things once, maybe twice, in my lifetime. This experience will make me a better person. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible. ",human
"First impressions always count no matter what and sometimes even impossible to change. Because,when meeting a new person or family member people judge on how people tend to act and speak. For example,if a women would like to apply for a new job and talked to the manager in a rudely manner her way of speaking and acting would affect her opportunity of working. So maybe think before what you're going to say because it affects your life. But,not only you but the others in the surrounding Therefore, being nice and kind to others helps the way people look and act when they show their first impressions to others.

First of all, first impressions not only are by judged by the person of a face but ,can sometimes leave a good mark or bad one because the way people look and the attitude they give. Sometimes that's why when people are going to give a first impression it has to be a clear and nice way so that the other gives back to people. Otherwise, when meeting with them later in the future they will regret to have spoken and talken to you because lack of behavior. So maybe think clearly andi treat others the way they do to others. Next time think of what positive things to share around and impressions to others.

Secondly, sometimes its impossible to change impressions and thats why we think before we speak. One way by noticing is when meeting a new person and by their first impression. Its says a lot by just looking at their behavior and attitude not only because the way they speak but interact with others. For example. when meeting a new employee at my job employees have to introduce themselves to each others so that they can create a long-lasting relationship. But, when meeting a new employee there was a guy and I introduced myself to him and he had just passed by without saying anything and was shocked when that happened.. Because, when meeting new people you have to introduce yourself to others like any other person in the world. Not only because their new but it helps people interact with each other.

Lastly, being able to give the first impression to others means a lot because it represents who you really are and the person you want to be. Therefore, people will comprehend the way you feel about others and how you treat them. So that your family and friends can be proud of who you are and realize who you've become as a person. Then, treat other with respect and kindness so that many others can spread positive things in life. maybe so later in life you can become someone and treat others the way you treat yourself. Then realize that first impressions always count as a good way to introduce yourself to others.

To summarize, the person who you are today is the person that can be later in life. Thats why first impressions always count no matter what and where you are and how you act as a person. Not only that but it also say a lot about people and you. Being kind and generous to others can affect the world by a lot not only by being kind but can help the people around you. Just by having a good impression of yourself people can take it to other good ways in life. So that's why we as persons have to be the that lead the next generation and with a good personality.",human
"Great opportunities for students to attend to classes from home by online way,

Well, Now a day with the new technology. Thinks get easy every day, Long time ago you had to attend to a regular school because there was no other way to attend to school and accomplish your career dream, But now we have new technologies that allow some school to give online classes from home, If you live far away from school and theres no way you can get to school faster and easily.

However, Some parents decided to enroll their children in a online school, Because they think thats better then to sent they to a regular school, In one point those parent are right because in a regular school you are not looking out their children, And they dont know what they are doing, Or even if they are in school or not, And also you dont know what class of friend does your child is hanging out with, Or if other children are bulling to your children,

In regular school you don't know whats going on,

But. by the other head in home school you can be with them during that time they dedicate to study, or even better if your schedule don't fit with the time they need to study, you can hire someone you have confidence with, To help you, In home school your child is not surround of bad children that can make your child feel depressed, So in this way you can see how your child is going in progress,

"There are many instances where people have the mindset that you must be doing something constantly in order to achieve the most. I believe that having this mindset is terrible and is not beneficial to the person. I believe this because if you take the time to rest you will find that it allows you to regain a creative mindset, it allows your work to regain its quality, and taking time to rest serves many health benefits.

Regaining a positive, creative mindset serves many purposes. Having a creative mindset will allow you to think freely, and come up with brilliant, unique ideas that give you an advantage over possible competition. For example, if you are constantly writing all the time you are not giving yourself time to create unique ideas that separate you from the rest of the competition. Another example we can use for this scenario is when an entrepreneur is constantly trying to start a business without taking a step back and allowing themselves to come up with a unique idea that they have passion for. Where as if someone who does take breaks is working in the same field as another individual they are working less, but achieving more because their ideas are more unique and thought through.

When you are constantly working there is a high chance that your work may lose its quality. When an individual is working the factor that they must think about most is the quality of the work they are providing. If the quality of the work is not there then it completely takes away from the rest of the qualities from that body of work. For example, if a man wants to sell a product, and he puts hours upon hours into this item but there is no quality then the item will not sell. Where as if the man takes constant breaks focusing on quality, and not quantity then the item will have a lot more attraction from people.

Being idle sometimes rather then working persistently also has its benefits. When working diligently all the time there may be times where you may be very stressed out or you've tired your body out, but these problems can be avoided. These problems can be avoided by taking breaks, taking breaks allows your mind to relax and release stress that has been piled over a certain amount of time. For example, if you are a athlete and you are constantly over working yourself there is a high chance you may get injured, but if you balance yourself and take breaks you are allowing your muscles to heal themselves which also boosts your performance for the next practice or game. Allowing yourself to take breaks also improves the quality of the work you provide whether its paperwork or sports.

Although some people think never being idle is a good thing because you can achieve more work with no set backs. I still think that being idle serves a purpose because you want to be able to incorporate quality into your work, you also want to be creative when it comes to providing, and lastly you want to be able to gain the benefits from relaxing your body and your mind. Finally, if you are one of the individuals who like to work diligently without breaks, you should at least consider taking a break once because it will not hurt you, and if anything it will help you.",human
"Some people says decisions should be make by our self, however others says you should make decisions fallowed by people who are more experts have more experiences and time to deal with hard decisions.

I support the idea that we should all make our own decisions because its our life we should know what's better for us for our future, however some people like to make decisions based on others people decisions they think they would do the same as others when they make the same choices that experts and experiences people make.

In one case i had to make a hard decision probably a life chancing decision i had to choose between staying at my country or come to U.S.A and have a better life or at least more opportunities at first i din'd know what to do i wasn't sure what would be the best or what wold be the consequences from a bad decisions i want it to ask people who has all ready make that decision what should i do what they think should be best for me but i didn't because that was my own choice a choice that no one else can make but me.

But their are some cases where decisions are not make by the person who the decision would affect like when youre a baby, or under the age parents are the ones who would make decisions for you they would do what they think is bets for you, and some times you may not agree with what they decided for you but in those cases is where people with more experiences and knowledge meant to know whats best for you.

However i think we should all be free of making our own decisions ether you want to make it by your self or you want others with more time and experiences to help or make your decisions, but people should be award of what they choice because every decision can gave a consequence and the only one who can make the right choice is you.",human
I would be interested in joining a program that you guys have to offer. I am very interested in automobiles and would want to look for any companies where I could work on vehicles as my career opportunity. I've always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me I would be happy just doing that for a long time. Ever since I was a kid i've worked on my dads' and uncles' car. By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since i've had experience with vehicles in my life time and working in a companies to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Through out the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by them selves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority and I am always hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle an high functioning machine with so much capabilities. I would love to one day work for Tesla or BMW in making electric to hybrid vehicles and knowing that it would be a fun career option while doing something that I always loved ever since I was a little boy I would be grateful. ,human
"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",human
"The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said,""No act of kindness, no matter how small,is ever wasted.""

In the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another

I hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. You also never know what someone else is going though ether.

I think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you don't have to be asked to do. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.

For Example, it a trash day were it came later then before me, and my step brother had to take the trash done to the side of the road. Will there was elderly layde that was outside when i was outside. in the place

I lived in there were always contortion going on. when we were my step brother had to get something and i stayed outside when the workers began to work aging. When they starred they scared the lady that was outside. I had to make a diction on if I should go in and get my mom or go to the lady that fell. I got my mom and went to her then my mom called 911

to come get her. When you do a good thing for someone they feel happy even if it is a small thing you do for them. That's why we need more people to do more acts of kindness.",human
"I think that older and younger students being together is a really good idea cause that means that the older student can help the younger student and If an older students needs help with something one of the younger students can possibly help. I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. Also the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older. I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because i think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and i just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. And maybe one of the older student can become really good friends with the younger one. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are really good cause students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends. I really think that students are smarter when they are with other students that are not in there age group.

"Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anyting you want. Knowledge is just using ur brain but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because its just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. Im going to tell you all the reason why!

Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using ur brain.

In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometime you can make up a plan by using ur imagination; Meanwhile, you can use ur Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are goiign to love it.

Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't belive me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important.

If you don't belive me belive Albert Einstien!

What would you like to use more your knowldge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important then knowledge. This is my opiaion but it could be your opiaion to. You need to try it, Im telling you it's so fun.

Imagination is really fun and helpfull in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong becuase how do you think that many people got out of there bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere. Like I said this is just my opiaion no one else.",human
"Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.",human
"On my opinion I be agree with the statement because He was one of the minister,who has more power from other's. Ms Winston had to help other's. For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go.

Them Let's say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: let's talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work.

In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too.

Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we don't have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future.

But many student had a long history or someone didn't graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to what's hard to work after school and don't have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

Also many student show what they can do and how far they can go, Also many emigrant people came here to found a safe place to live so the mind on our country we don't many security.

Now I'M be here work hard, sometimes I like to help people when they get travel or didn't understand what we do. Also I tells them to din't do bad things cause if you get travel you get problem them your record contain a bad thing, until now I to my best it's hard sometime to understand but everyday when I be at home I practice or read book thats one thing can help everyone who want to learn more English. For example if you read a book like 20 minutes you learn and know how to pronounce that work that help you to main ten your vocabulary an read faster.

I'm a student who like to help others and like to share new ideas with other and talk about what we want to on a future. a couples of thing I want to share are : thanks the program for help us and the teacher who help us with new things everyday.",human
"The Primer Minister Winston Churrchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" And the question is about angree or desag.

My opinion is desagree because the Primer Minister wiston not is try to motivate to onther person to do again. First,reason when something person loss manytime something and feel what if continue does again can obtain something good in the future. Because never said end. Second, reason the failure plays inthe life a paper strong in the life of every person in the world. But when any person not try more time that one is clear that is going to failure and never feel what is obtain something good in the futured. The decition every person have nothing can said what try againt. The decition is of your selft. My position is what if I whole my life said not and not continue consist in something never can obtain something.

When have the oportunity of obtain something and gain something never say I failure least when have a enthusiasm of obtain. Never person have the right to says you never can't do. forever cave you personas negatives and thoght negative in the life. But every pesona have the right to attain something. For example: I have goals in my life what is gradution and have my diploma and can continue in the college. For can gain this gold and my dream i have enthusiasn and an person positive. Also if I have failure in my gold I have of up and againt.

Form not failure has try more of one times. The reasons are clear if an have enthusiasm for something I loss the possible to go back to againt. I also think what the Prime Minister Winstor Churchill loss something for what the that try todo is what the person not continue there are and losss your enthusiasm for something what hill obtain. There are many success about failure but the failure arrive when the problem don't have solution. Becasuse also have the right to fight for obtain the solocion to the failure.

When us arrive to the failure have the right of to do again but other form. Sometime the life us play's different suitation what think that not obtain solution but many pesons said what there are form all have solution lest when an dead. These is other example when one person dead and before to dead have failure many time in yours objetives an don't know say there are fight for obtain the solution.

The life arrow as the world an never have the solution in the hand to all problems butnot signific what noy have solution. Never there are said not can't. The final of failure forever have solution. Is as when an company is goint to bankarrot. They try to share solution form the failure. For there nevere said that no can't share solution to the every failure.

My conclusion is that never lost the energy for figth for the solution. Forever cave sometihing what have hopeful in your self. No lost yor hope eve search the solution to the failure.

"Identify a Career Before High School

Have you ever heard about those societies that expect students to identify a career before getting into high school? Last week I was reeding the newspaper and there was a special new that really got my attention. The new was talking about a new society which wants all students to idenfy a career before they get in high school. Because some students think is not necessary, there is a big debate going on.

I believe that is good to implant to students the idea to commit to a career before getting into high school because then when they start high school they will choose the necessary classes which will help them to earn knowledge of this career. Another reason is that they will not be getting distracted later on thinking about what career should they select. If the students choose a career before getting into high school, they will get mature and they will be prepared to be more formal and follow the steps to graduate on time and then start working on the few steps that they will have for achieving completely their dreamed career.

I believe that if studdents choose their career before starting high school it will be easier for them in the future. I have a niece that is in 8th grade in middle school, she is almost about to start high school. My niece was telling me the other day that she loves medicine, and she would love to become a doctor. She told me that she asked to her counselor for some classes recomendations. Her counselor recommended to her a medicine's academy and also some extra science and health classes. Now she is excited to start high school.

If students decide what career are they interested on before getting into high school will help them to clear their mind. Once they get the opportunity to choose their classes schudele for high school they will have in ind that they should pick classes that are related to the career that they want to achieve. When I was in high school I did not even know what a career was, because the teachers in middle school nor my parents never mentioned it. When I was going to start high school I remember that the summer after starting high school, all the future new niners were called to a meeting. In this meeting we were supposed to choose our new classes for our first year in high school. They gave us all a really big list of classes from where we could choose, and because I did no know anything, and I had not any plans for my future, I chose the same classes that my other friend was choosing. When I was in my Senior year the questions started ""so what is your plan after graduating?"" ""what is your dreamed career?"" I was completely lost, so I went to talk to my counselor and she explained me what a career was. I said I wanted to be periodist, and then I realized that I wasted my opportunities of earning knowledge and practice during my first high school years. I could have been in leadership class and learn how to talk to people, I could have been part of the high school newspaper, or take some classes where they teach you how to give speeches. After I graduated I had to take special courses online, because I did not know anything about periodism.

If students decide what career they want, they will feel cofidents and they will act in the way that this career asks for them to act. They will become more mature and take high school as a more serious thing. Some of my old class mates from when I was in high school were always playing around and getting in trouble, because they said high school did not really teach you what you ""needed"", but I believe that they said that because they were not learning about what they really were interested on. They used to go to dance class when what they really wanted to become after was a lawyer, or a doctor.

Other people believe that this will give students extra stress while they are thinking like an adult when they are in middle school. They believe that students are not old enough to decide what they really want, and that they might change their mind later. This people think that the best age for choosing a career is when the students have already graduated from high school.

In conclusion I believe that this idea that the new society wants to implant to the students is good, because students should take high school seriously, they are super close to become adults and they will have to decide what they want to do with their life, and as sooner as they decide the most beneficial for them it will be.

"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isn't obtained by many but it certainly isn't hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money.

Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually don't stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and don't get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, don't let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier.

Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""I'm not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he would've change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasn't smart enough for this job i wouldn't have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise.

Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesn't give you eternal happiness a good attitude will.

Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and that's attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.  ",human
"In the United States the use of technolgy had positive affects on people's lives. If people dont use technology it would be hard to do the stuff people usually do. People can get a job by using technology, shop, and talk to each other no matter where they are. Now days people can't live without technology because it had made their life easier and it is hopefull to everyone who works, who goes to high school and, also if you stay at home. Technology allows people to do many tasks without having contact with others.

Now days to find a job, people do not go to the companies and ask for an application. They use technology to make a resume and just wait on what the companie is going to say. It is easy for people who doesn't have transportaion,

they can get a job by staying at home and use technology. People who works far away from their house need transportation if they want to call the boss they need a cellphone or something that has something to do with technology. when technology didin't exits it was hard for people.

Technology helps people to shop by just using the internet, now days we have a lot of stores that people only can buy stuff by using the internet and it is good because if someone want something they just need to use the phone and go to a store application. Over 98% people around the word use technology to shop. If people shop online they're not going to loose a lot of money because the prices that they have are good. this is really hopefull to a lot of people and to people who play games the internet is a good setting to nuy.

technology helps people to talk to each other no matter where they are, it is know that our planet is big and people lives all around the word, some people don't have the opportuntie to travel to see their family, friends and get to know more about our culture, but now that peole has technology it is easier because you can talk to peole that is on the other side of the world, you can get to know more about our culture just by looking at pictures or videos or you can do stuff without speaking to another person.

technology has helped people a lot in everything day do every day, if people stay one day without technology they are going to see the diference of having technology and not having it. becuase if you go to your job you use it, if you go to school you use it, of course people can live without it but is going to be harder to do the stuff we usually do, that is why people continue making more and more technology to make adiference in our planet and to make people's lives easier.",human
"Many people think that older students can be helpful to the younger students on the other hand many people think that the older student can not be helpful to the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you. to ilistued. when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didn'et know what are the school rules and i didn'et know any thing about school and also i did'net know how to speak English. So there was students how was older then me and the help me where was my classroom because i was getting losed in school and every time when i was getting in to boy bathroom there were showed me where was girl bathroom and they were helped me how to speak English.

The older students are available to assist the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something. ",human
"I think some people might find visiting a national park enjoyable because it features better activities and it also attracts more people around the World for example the Grand Canyon or hiking mountains attracts lots of older people from all over the world every single year.

But others might like Community parks because there's not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in.

I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc, in a community park because you can can play there any time with friends and family it's also free, you can also meet new people in a park or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer team's and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, that's what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life for ever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom.

Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have really good soccer player like Messi, Luis Suarez and Couthino and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship.

also every 4 years there's the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup.

In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more then one million! In conclusion who doesn't want to get paid one million dollars for playing an awesome sport and if youre a girl don't worry because there's also soccer teams for girls and they can also join big soccer teams and make money just like boys and it's also proven that people who play sports are healthier and have better muscles they also eat healthy foods and fruits and run train every day to burn out calories so that they be in shape when they play in their soccer team's and they why i think someone might find that enjoyable.",human
"I believe that working in groups benefits more than someone working alone. Working in groups help you gather more knowledge, you get to learn and have fun, and you get to finish faster.

When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some dont. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone working alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge.

Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they dont get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do.

I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies i feel good because the job is done and i get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at there own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type.

In conclusion, working in groups benefits you more because of all of these reasons. Finally, I suggest that every one should try to make or find a group so that all these reasons open up to you.",human
"A positive attitude is what we expect in everything and everyone whether it be from;a customer service employee,teachers speaking to sporadic students,and or a bus driver driving a bus full of disrespectful kids. The lessons they burn in your head as a kid is that a positive attitude can take you places beyond your wildest dreams and those who have a negative attitude will have a unfortunate future brought upon themselves, in all honesty through my words I don't believe a positive attitude can lead to a successful life its our decisions in the making that do decide it instead. The saying that nice guys finish last is one heck of an understatement in the least, you could be the most positive person on the planet and still have shortcomings when it comes to a successful life .

A positive attitude is just what it is, it doesn't guarantee anything sure it might be helpful when getting the things you want in life but it can only go so far in within its own limitations whether it be giving and employer a positive attitude during a job interview of a job you've always wanted while ignoring how severely under qualified you are in the field. The idea alone of someone truly believing that you can be successful with a positive attitude is a joke,if anything the person believing a positive attitude is what makes them successful isn't in on the joke they are the joke.

Similar to a positive attitude a negative is never a guarantee to a successful life at least with a negative attitude you won't see the world in rose colored glasses if anything you see it for the harsh reality it truly is rather then doing pointless things to make life just a little bit more worth your time rather then forcing a positive attitude just to take in the world easier. In my eyes its just some facade we all have the ability to put up but some choice to live in la la land while others live in the real world dealers choice really.

Our attitudes is just one thing that can change the course of our lives the real way we make it in life is how we do so with our decisions towards that successful life that everyone desires. Its a bittersweet reality on those who constantly maintain a positive attitude those kind of people are taken advantage of their kindness and will often be misunderstood with the people around them. The real way to live is to have an iron will that shows that you are not someone to be messed with but, someone who is respected and can hold their own with making heavy decisions rather then keeping it all happy go lucky.

The debate about whether or not a positive attitude or a negative attitude can make you successful in life is kinda of like those other world debates about what happens when we die, is there life other then humankind, is there really a god. Its all based on interpretations or our upbringings into this beautiful disgusting world that is life you can be born with a sliver spoon in the mouth with a negative or born in a war torn country with a positive attitude its not about how we should make a successful life with attitudes its about how we make of it.",human
"Why is it good to have a good attitude even if you have a difficult time? When you have a job you cant go to work with a bad attitude people will never come back. In the other hand good attitude make people want to come back and take to you. Even if you have a difficult time at less show a smile for other people to see that can make them feel good,and that might even make you feel batter.

There are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him.

In a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two.

When you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people.

when you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others. Overall there is no right or wrong you just pick what you learn best and just do it.              ",human

every time you failure more and more ,every time you learn something new , for example :

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

"Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life.

I think people should ask for help and guidance from their parents and teacher before making important life decisions. Both my parents and my teachers know my strengths and weaknesses and can help me in making the best decisions.",human

After then, I would love to schedules live events where my fans can enjoy playing and meeting new people. Some Ideas I would like to add is have large station were they can eat and talk. Another idea would be for my fans to be able to meet me in real life and take pictures or autograph with me. The greatest idea I would like to add is to be able to earn ten-thousand dollars. You can be able to earn ten-thousand dollars by 1v1 me in a match. These event will only take places on Sundays which I will be putting it on my stream.

In conclusion, I think that you should let me visit or become a twitch member because I had always wanted to become a professional gamer. Twitch can help me achieve the goal by letting me stream on there platform. If I earn the job then I can get people to tune in to my stream and enjoy the entertainment, competitive game play, and live events preserve for them. This is why you should allow me to join your community and allow me to become a part of the family.

"This shows how students could think and have thoughts about what they want in the future, a career is what benefits them in their lives, preparing them would make a change in their minds on what they really are interested in or what would they want to be successful in their future, it would take time to prepare to finally decide whats on their minds to choose their careers as a young age, this opportunities will make a big change is students choose wisely.

After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,the're changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life.

This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think the're going to be success.

However, letting young kids think on what the're going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didn't decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldn't get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didn't want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didn't decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what they're looking for in real life as a young adults.

By telling this students should see and think very carefully as parents understands their children and teachers helping their students how they could or might do to get that career on what they need to focus on, for society is really difficult to choose right ways hat might help students and which ones might not letting students choose sense their getting more knowledge they will increase the capacity to get into what career benefits them as students,there are many student that want a career and the society helps them with their courses a they are getting into High School, their final thoughts and knowledge finish for them and they should start to think more in what he career is and how they're going to deal with their job ",human
"For the time students get to high school, Is time for the students to focus more on their future. Students that go to high school are expecting to do more work and be with a different mind set. Going to high school, is the time when students need to think what they want to do in the future, and pick a career that they like. But there are many students, that don't care about their futures, others don't think about their futures in high school. High school is the time when students are able to get focus and think about a career they wanna take. Also to pick a career that you like,and you enjoy doing it. But there are many students that take career just to take them but thats no the career they like so they end it up not achieving nothing.

In high school, is where a lot of students work so they can get money and buy what they want and Also to pay their college career. So identify a career by the time students get to high school help. Because now the students now how much does the career cost, and where he can go studied when he finish high school. Also choosing a career when your young helps, because students have more time to get more information, about the career. And see if there are others career that students would like to take. So thats why committing to a career by the time you get to high school helps you, have more time to view different careers and choose the one u like the best.

Many student that are almost in high school, think about how high school going to be like. So been able to choose a career before high school helps. Because the student can get their mind set and think about what courses the student wants to take in high school. Those courses can help, because it teach the student the things that he needs to learn therefore hes prepare the career, he wants to take. And also to be able to search where the he wants to go studied and pick the collage that teach the best for his career.

And finally preparing for a career before high school, gives the students more opportunities. So I agree for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. also high school has a lot opportunities, for students that wants to take collage course. So they can be prepare for their careers, and when they get to collage they now a lot about the career they want to take. So it helps committing to a career before going to high school it can get you prepare for your future. And acomplish what you want for your future.    ",human
"Sucsses is the common word that we hear every day, and everyone want to became successful in their life.

The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument.

Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy.

The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future.

Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that.

At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something. Because school is our main resourse of learning.                                      ",human
"One educational activity I like to do is doing a science project is the most fun thing to do with your friends. This type of projects give you a lot of knowledge, and this projects give you an idea on how nature works is easy to do and is fun. Also getting help form your friends is better everyone gets to give ideas and help with the fun project. A science project is also fun because you get to work with chemicals and see the reaction of each chemical. This is one of the most enjoyable educational things to do.

Doing a science project gives knowledge specially if is about nature. If the project is about nature the things you'r gonna learn are fun and easy for example what causes wind,solar system,and how does the moon help us this projects are gonna make you learn about how earth works. Learning is boring but the science projects make learning more fun and it gives ideas for future projects. Also working as a team with you'r friends is helpful because you get to hear different parts,and it would help you learn more about the project you are doing.

Working as a team to see the different points of view of everyone is fun,and it helps for the project. This is fun because you get to help friends out, and do experiments with chemicals. Presenting the the project would make you nervous if your by your self if you did it in a group its gonna be fun and also more easy. Working on a project with friends is always gonna be fun specially on a science one because you have to repeat the project three times to make sure it gives the same result every time and its super educational to do.

The chemicals you use during a project could be dangers but at the same time they could be fun to use. This is an educational fun project because you get to see how the reaction of different chemicals. The most fun part of a project is that you get to repeat things more then once in order to get the correct results is the most fun thing during a project testing out stuff. This is one of the most enjoyable educational stuff you can do and its fun.

This is an enjoyable thing to do you have so much fun doing a project,and Helping out friends by giving them ideas for the project working as a team to make it perfect and learning. For me this is the most fun thing to do when i have a project, and theres so many more activities but a science project is enjoyable to do and is also the most fun thing to do.

"This program is helpful for younger students because it would get work accomplished with the presence of the older student. Older students that volunteer helping younger students would make younger students feel more at ease.

"Aiming too low and falling short isn't the best way to be successful.

Being confident in what you're doing is great but what if you're too confident ? Not everyone has the same definition of success; Your vision of success might be their way of seeing failure. By setting your goals low, you're taking the potential risk of not attending the necessary capacities expected from you.

When aims are set high, you are also sure to achieve your marks, have the pride of succeeding and be confident in what you're doing, this affects your mood too, therefore you are happy in how well you are doing, have the desire too do even better.

The science fair is coming up this month; Doing a project on volcanoes sounds like a good idea, you're familiar with the subject and have done it before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, all though; This idea is unoriginal and five other students are thinking the same way as you are, by doing the volcano project, you would be aiming low, you must get out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals. Choosing another subject for your scientific project without being boring and using a real life causes would impress the judges, give them useful information without being too specific.

By setting your aim too high you are taking a risk and could possibly fall short, but by aiming low you are closing the opportunities of going bigger and doing something you wouldn't normally do that could lead to potential Utopian future of yours.     ",human
"Good Morning,

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.",human

"People say first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think you can change someone by getting to know each other, spending more time together, or ask them how they feel.

If you start talking to someone for the first time and you think their personality is really bad try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think they're mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back.

You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might of changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. There's people that their personality are just different and you have to accept it.

Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. It's better to be there for them or help each other out.

In conclusion, people say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" because you never know why they behave like that. If you don't know them, still ask if they're okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person.        ",human
"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works.

If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused.

Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they won't lose points and grades.

On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you won't receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they won't be confused or fail the class.

In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs.",human

"Students should commit to a career at a young age or specifically by the time they get to highschool. Most students know what they wanna do when they get to highschool so its a good idea to commit to a career that you are interested in and enjoy so you can start preparing for a job/career in that field of study.

Yes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue. Highschool offers many electives and academy classes that students should take advantage of to stay ahead of the game in what they wanna do as a career. Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career.

Secondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Most students don't take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Another reason is that if you're confident in what you wanna do you'll be able to achieve your goal. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career.

Lastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. It could also help out with expenses and anything else. The earlier the better and more opportunitys would be opened to students.

In conclusion, students should commit to a career sometime in highschool just so they can start preparing and builidng up confidence in what they wanna do. Take advantage of classes in highschool because they are free and very helpful for the future. Overall once you find someting you like doing and want to do that as a career then commit.",human

However, some of the decisions they may have are hard way or easy way, the hard way is they have to try hard in life: study so you can have a good grade and work hard, the easy way is they have to put stuff or money on the first start of they future decisions, is a short way but is really hard and not all people can make that decisions depend on if they want it or not. Also depend on where they at in life for a example: people have alot of money the way they want their decisions on future is more short because they don't worry about other thing tact or payment and people are not have alot of money the way they start their future decisions are more longer because they have to worry about alot of money tact, payment, pay for their car,... also they have a to work more extra hard for they decisions. I meet a friend, he was go to school and work in the same time he was about to out of high school and go to collenge but he maked a bad decision on his life, he about to out of high school but he stop and he said to me that ""go to work are making more money than go to school"" so he stop school, his job now is doing nail that job do sometime do alot of money and sometime don't and he don't want to try more hard, he can go to collnge and later on got a good job make more money than Nail but lose that chance and it change his live forever now he can't take it back. And my brother was the same thing, he was go to collenge for 2 year and than he don't want to be in collenge more so desige to work, if he continue on collenge maybe he got a better job. So sometime people have to think of what about to happen in their future and desige what they gonna be in future lean on what they have and about to have. People can make their own decision but sometime they need help so other can support their life decisions. However alot of people don't know what they gonna do in a future, they don't know what they like or interesting job to do on future so they are stuck, they need help to chose their stuff that may interesting them later on in life.

The chose they have and everything that happen around them to make their own future decisions, and all of the support from people around or family can make it more better decisions on their own life. They have to desige their own life, work hard so they can have a good life on future and do anything they want. If people work hard enough so later on their children can more easy to make their decisions about their own life. ",human

"Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become.

First off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that you're a head. People who don't know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college they'll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. He also told me, It wasn't easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon you'll be proud or yourself.

Secondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc. But that's only what they have to face. For the people who don't know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didn't think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. It's better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time.

Lastly, having to learn different careers is good, but it'll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. But just knowing one career you'll be able to focus on that specific career. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. It's better to have a head start from everyone than being last.

Therefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon it'll be too late. ",human

"When did you decide to research your future job?

Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.

First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.

Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to.

Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students life's. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.

In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Also it's a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school. ",human
"Students failure the game every time when we have a game with another team, because for some reasons they do not beat the game. Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.

Family is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.

Some students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.

Eating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.

Please help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world.

"Imagine a place where honesty is the best policy.

I disagree with the old proverb because honesty might hurt peoples feels around you, honesty can make people not like you no more, and honey can not be used in a matter that you speaking of.

First when you tell people how you really feel about them it might hurt you in a way too, when people find out how you feel about them it can be good or bad, when people tell true about someone it may hurt them, and how people tell you how they feel about you it can be hurtful.

Second when you tell someone how much you do not care about them can make you look bad, when you have a friend that you tell stuff that you do not like about him can be hurtful, when you talk about people in front of them can not help your friendship with them, when you said hurtful things about them they will not like you any more,and how you tell people about what you do not like about them it can be harsh.

Finally when you tell people how you really feel in a different way can still be hurtful, the way you tell someone you do not like them can be more hurtful to them, when you speak of some one but in a different way can still grateful of hurtful, when you talk about someone in a nice vice but it can still be mean, and how you talk about someone is up to you no matter what you say.

Lakers, and won fore champions chip games. He was the player in the leage no one can stop him, people call him The Black Mamba because he was too fast.

"Community parks provide a lot of fun ways to spend time outdoors. One of my three favorite ways to spend time outside would be playing sports, gardening and exercising. It's a productive way to spend your weekends.

First, Playing sports outdoors is very fun way to spend the day. You can play with your family and friends. You learn about communication and teamwork while playing sports. Communication is a life skill that is used everyday. You'll always talk to someone weather your saying good morning or good night speaking is always needed when talking to someone. Teamwork shows you how to value players on a team. Knowing your teammates worth and dreams is always a great way to start a lifetime friendship. Playing sports outdoors is a great way to spend your time.

Next, Gardening is a way to help out plants and to have fun. Gardening or watering plants gives the plants energy. Gardening may be done with family and friends. Your spending quality time with those around you. Buying seeds and planting them helps out the plant world by giving them new places to live. You may fix up the parks gardens to make it look nice. You don't lose anything from watering plants. Cutting grass or cleaning up around the neighbor hood is a good thing to do. Your doing a favor to your neighbors and nature. Gardening is a relaxing and fun way to spend your day outdoors.

Finally, Exercising isn't done by many people, people just want to spent time indoors and just watch television. Exercising is very important for humans to do. An average human is suppose to exercise three times a week. Going to the park and going for a run is a great way to exercise. Your loosing body fat and building up muscles. You may see animals and plants while your running. You can also exercise with your family and friends you don't have to exercise alone. Exercising is very relaxing and it's helps with blood pressure. You don't have to eat that healthy but its good to exercise at least three times a day.

In Conclusion, Spending time outdoors is very enjoyable. You can do these activities with the people around you. Three enjoyable ways you can spend time outdoors is by playing sports, gardening and exercising ",human
"Did you know that one of our students got 1000 dollars cash price because our principal put him in one of our school activity ! Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things.

This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there.

New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends !

Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity.

If a student is good or great at there activity. They can also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree.

Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students don't know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just don't know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future out.

Students can get to know each other more, students can get a collage degree, and students can learn new things. Students can get better in school with this and there future can be made with this too. I think this is going to be a good plan for students and kids.",human
"Yes you can influence other people by you setting a good example by your own behavior. When you give someone advice, on what not to do or what to do, they won't take you serious because you're not following your own advice. They'll see you as if you're playing around if you do the opposite of what you told them. That's why a lot of people say ""Actions speak louder than words"". There's a difference on saying things, and actually doing them.

Therefore, there are people who knows you, and want to be like you. You never know if they can come up to you, out of nowhere and ask for opinions and advice. You can't just say anything, you can say something you do, and something you follow. Keep in mind that there's a lot of things people see in you. How you behave can change the way they see you too. Believe it or not, people actually see what you do. If you have siblings, they see your actions without you knowing, and they could do the same things. Giving advice to people is easy, but they would want to see you follow your own advice too.

There's people who you might not know, but they do know you and they act the way you do because of the way they've seen you behave around them or around other people.

"In the United States, the limitation to human contact due to technology has had a positive effect on people's lives. in mordern times, technology has been very helpul to everyone. Technology performs multi-tasks without physical contacts with others. Due to this, people don't have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health.

Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lifes, accidents, and most importantly many deaths.

Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who don't like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. Even though they don't make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the society's well being which evryone today wants. Again this brings us to the good part about social media, though kids may not have physical contacts with friends, they have the social media.

Big Thanks to technology, there might not be human contact but it is going to the positively change peoples lives. The world will be a better place.",human
"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

"Many schools have partnerships with companies that allows students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment.

To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it.

Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didn't continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didn't find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal.

We can't improve our skills until we don't try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we don't we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with

IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. It's all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday.

In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.                              ",human

"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.    ",human
"Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This quote indecteds that becoming successful is a lie in life that dose not have challenges,failures and have hard time in life to achive your goals and, without making it intersting. However, a lot of people belives this quote, because success is nothing with haveing enthusiasm and, lossing or being fail on something and being positive about it.

First, Haveing successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a succesful its to make you a a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benfits from that hard or easy challenges.

secondly, makeing you challenigs intersting would led to be come successful, the reason why because having intersing and positive attuide towards your challengs would make it easire to handle. For example if your lossing a bussines or challnge do not bring nagitive atomsphere around it because it would never let your mind to have more oppotrunity that you could done more.

In my piont of view, failing or lossing is lie if you do not try hard for the intersting and successful goals. If you are lossing a challenge it okay to loss but with positive thought and never give up on the difficults challenge you have to face in you way to successful life and gaols. However a lot of people gives up on the diffecult challenges because its too hard for them to handle and at end they would have more diffcult thing to face. Make your challenges intersting it dose not matter if you fail it it matter how you play it.",human
"A Former British Man a Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''

success consists of going from failure to failure wi t hout loss of enthusiasm

.''

is like saying that people are more afraid of success that they're are in failure. what Winston is talking about that is okay to lose once in awhile as long you have that smile in your face that you already a winner of yourself, like playing a soccer game but your team loses but you lose as a team, failing a quiz you just gotta do better in the retake you can't give up on something that is precious to you. People make mistake and people learn from it just try to do better next so you can succeed on winning. Some people are scared to take the chance to succeed because that taking a risk of failure and people have but you won't know if you try. Winston Churhill want people to never give up on your dream. if you learn more about the subject you won't got no worried about a thing. Once I was little I have a hard time learning and participating in class that my mother and father didn't knew about the time that they constant working to provide us a house,food,and clothes. I have to restart kindergarten because of my failure that I didn't bother asking my mother about was my mom knew about they took me to a doctor to check on me that I have a learning factor my mother was worried that I have to transfer every school that have a program for me then there was one school that help me learn better communicate with teacher answering question when I first started highschool I look back when I was little and started to laugh and think I have so many chances to succeed in life that one day I'll go back to the teacher and say thank you for everything so I have to go through of failing but never lose my hope of becoming a winner.

I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up,human
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends. They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. ",human
"Why people should make their own decisions for them self.

Should people make their own decisions? yes people should make their decisions because important, people will accomplish more faster, and teaching responsibly.

People make decisions important. Everyone wants to feel like they play an important role in the family. By allowing your children to help decide entertainment or snack types, you give them a place in the family where they realize their voice are heard. from something as simple as deicing which good thing to buy they can feel like they are a part of the family more so than will be present they simply want to matter.

When people make their own decision people will accomplish more faster. When you know exactly what you are trying to achieve, you can do it faster period. I doubt that requires more explanation speed comes from greater clarity of purpose and process.

People make decision teaching responsibility. Not all decisions can be met with a successful experience. Perhaps a child picks a movie that is not as good as he or she thought it would be or dessert was disappointing in last. This can help you teach you child to learn from previous experiences. He or she needs learn that not all decisions have a good and positive out come and we learn from this process to make better decisions next time.

Should people make their own decision, it is important for themselves, and important role in the family. People can teaching a child decision have good things and positive. When people make decision they will accomplish more faster you can know exactly what you are trying to achieve.",human
"There are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. Completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. it's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsiblity on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. My favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family,talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. Even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done.

The activity is enjoyable because my friends and I get to do experiments together as a group. We assign a person to do a different task so everyone can work. Our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. Doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. This activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. These are the reasons why i think completing a science experiment is a enjoyable and educational activity.",human

This is why each day we see more and more people becoming greater then what they already are in life.

When accomplishing more things if we always doing something, people seem to get or fine benefits by doing by doing this task. People are being able to gain more knowledge from this because, they're simply putting in lots of detication and time into always doing tasks.

Getting money by accomplishing more is a big achievement for mostly everone, they are able to save,spend, and as well as helping family or close friends. There're are many people out there that wanna give back to their love ones for many reasons and the only way by doing this is being preductive in accomplishing more.

The most important part of accomplishing more of someting is by, by being productive when deciding to part the amount of affort you want to accomplish what someone one wants. People that seek goals for themselves always seem to be the most preductive, only because they visualize big things in their futrue. Being Preductive is amazing thing, because it doesnt show a weakness inside the person, and it is a way to show strength, as well as showing hunger for what you are striving for in life. Setting examples to others that you are preductive and are accomplishing more and big things, is gonna look good on someone simply because, they see the outcome of the hardwork, and detication put into doing more of something.

In conclusion, if we accomplish more by doing something; we will become remarkable in many differnent ways.

By challenging their selves to go down the road as something big all they need to do is be preductive with thierselves, actknowlege that they will have benefits, and learn why it will help them beocme who they want to be.

"Cell phone should be allow in classroom

Cell phone are very useful in our daily life, we use them at home to see our social media and to be in contact with our family and friends that are far away from us, to buy thing, at work for any emergency and to make our shop list, but in a classroom maybe not much. Although, Some people believe that the cell phones shouldn't be allow in classroom. Actually, I think that cell phone should be allow in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want.

Some people that believe that cellphones shouldn't be allow in classroom have their reasons. They think that students that use their cell phone in classroom don't pay attention at what the teacher is teaching them and that could be something that might help them in the future and they think that it is really disrespectful for the teacher that the students use their cell phone during class while he is talking. Also they think that student might use their cell phone to cheat during a test.

Cellphone allow students to find any information fast about what they need for the class or group project. A school computer sometimes takes a several moment to log in. Waiting for the computer to log is really stressful because we might not have much in class and many students work after schools so they might not have time to finish it at home. Also help students that are new in this country and that do not know English. They can translate any word they don't know in English. This way students learn more English and faster.

The students can use their cell phone to write notes on their cell phone that they can read at any time they want because students are often using their cell phone. students might in their work, in their friend's house, walking home or any where else and they just need to take out their cell phone. Also students they can study for a test anywhere they go at any time they want to because they always have their cell phone with them.

In conclusion, the students should be allow to use their cellphone in classroom because it allow students to find information fast about what they need and they instead of using a computer or dictionary can write note on their cellphone that they can read at any time they want and wherever they go.

Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected.

In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not.

This why I think a experiment is a enjoyable activity.

"Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

I try my best to leave a smile on my face and just have a great and postive day. Another example is when I see it in other people would be just diffrent because people are diffrent and they act diffrent in every way. What I mean by that is that they can be either mad, sad, or annoyed, or just super excited to have a great day. Why I say that they can act diffrent in the morning or afternnoon is because when your going to work your maybe tired and exhasted and stayed up till like 12 AM for an asssignment for your job. Same with school. On the other hand there could be people that are super excited to have such a great day for work or school. Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assingment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes there's people that can't wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that. On the other hand there's some people that are so tired that they can't even drive or even talk to the person that they've been picked up by. I've seen it all from so many people.

"I'm not against having the after school homework club. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.",human
"This is a good idea, and the educators should be agree with this. Summer Break should be more longer. We fell the summer is not enough time for us to enjoy the vacations. We need more weeks to rest and enjoy the beach and many things. I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break. because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. I think idea is great. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer.

Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. The educators should know this and think about. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students.

In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family. This is how the school should be because it is hard to be here everyday, and it is so boring sometimes. This is what I think that how the school should be, but every head is a different world, and that make think the people in different ways to do things.",human
"No! it is not a good idea to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years. People think the actual life of a person starts after the high school but most of the students wants to graduate early to go collage or start working. Because they want to graduate early, they have only time to complete their requirement courses for early graduation. They do not have the option to take elective courses in high school which make them confuse in collage; what they want to do, they need to take extra classes ,and they have no vacation for relaxation.

When the student grow, their interest of subject changes because they came out in a real world. They observe from their around,what they want to do and what they want to be but in early graduation they have only choices to complete requirement courses in given time which make them specific and confuse in collage. When they go to collage they have some specific options to choose courses, if they want to do something different from what the choices they have they need to take elective courses in collage which make the study more harder than what they have. Because they want to graduate early, they have only time to complete their requirement courses for early graduation. They do not have the option to take elective courses in high school which make them confuse in collage; what they want to do, they need to take extra classes ,and they have no vacation for relaxation.

If the student did the early graduation and planing to take admission in collage and get admission in course, what they want to persuade .The classes they took in the high school are only for graduation requirement and the study you want to persuade is different then the elective classes ,you need to take extra classes in summer or night time to complete your graduation credits to complete the course. It is important to do four year high school graduation ,in the first year of high school ,they understand what they want to do in future and start taking those classes which help them to graduate early from collage. Because they want to graduate early, they have only time to complete their requirement courses for early graduation. They do not have the option to take elective courses in high school which make them confuse in collage; what they want to do, they need to take extra classes ,and they have no vacation for relaxation.

When the student did the early graduation and they want to go in collage, and take the admission in a course which the student have no high school credits and the student never took in school. They need to take a extra classes in summer break or in the evening time. When you are in collage you need to do some internship in the evening time , if you are study skillful course, so you can understand practically but you have extra classes in the evening time , its difficult to do job or internship in the evening time. Collage education is harder but if you have extra classes in the evening and in summer break, you do not have the time took some time off from collage and job and do some vacations. Because they want to graduate early, they have only time to complete their requirement courses for early graduation. They do not have the option to take elective courses in high school which make them confuse in collage; what they want to do, they need to take extra classes ,and they have no vacation for relaxation.

"People should seek guidance for help, because like us are still having trouble in the real world even if we graduate from high school or college, we even still have trouble trying to make our live easy. Having guidance is always helpful and learn something new.

Reason to have guidance is to release stress or don't add more stress. In daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. People stress things out and they don't know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work. Guidance could help us by rethinking our plans or working. While taking a guidance you could learn more things that we didn't know of.

Having guidance will also help you keep tack in time and help everything more clean in your work space. It good idea to have an open mind and have work done easier and fast. Having an open mind can give a good mind set in life and think more a head in time and saving time.

Another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer. Depressing is a big thing that come to life in everyone and it cause a lot problem the way they living. Most of the population on earth have depressing in their life, so it a good idea to seek help at all time. People who having that need get some help from guidance right away to tell them what going on in their life, it could help them cure their depressing.

It a bad idea to to let people guide they own way without any help at all, because trying teach yourself is hard enough, and try to teach yourself might get even more worst because they mind might be wrong and could cause more problem in later runs. People rather do it on their own and not get help because it might give them false inform that they need to learn or think it a waste of time, but guidance are here to help. Having guidance will always help you and they always teach you more things. People can still guide on they own way, but it better to get guidance. It be more easier and get better in live in the long run.

In conclusion, guidance are here to help release stress, learn better, get thought life, cure depressing, saving time, give more open mind it, have work done in time, and make life little bit more easy.",human

"I think that failure plays a crucial role during the persuit of sucess.

Failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one.

everyone fails sometime in their life .

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity.

Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again.

A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely.

Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success.

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. I think that faiture Plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success.

If there were not mistakes in life. Then no one would learn from then. Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

My conclusion is Faiture can change who you are and what path you're on in life, and I believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success.

Mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger.

Without faiture, no one would be sucessful.

I think this a perfect activity because kids like to compete each other and is better when they know that if they win they get some candys.

Another enjoyable activity will be in science, doing a project of how animals live what thay ate and how they survive to the other animalto and give some importants facts to the teacher ,

i think this project may be of two persons because a think this will be to easy for them and there may be some student doing the project by them self.

I think that will like the project because they can get to know about an animal life and importants stuff about it and they can have fun with friends.

I choose math and science because this are my favorites subjects and i enjoy doing them with my friends and my teachers my favorite part is when we get to work in group that is in science, but in math my favorite part is when i get a question right some time the teacher give me some candys.

First need to plan your work and need to be organized and have good details about what you need to read and need to wright. All what you have in your head just wright it all on paper first or then wh en your weighting your book or story you will have everything in copy and can read it to make sure its good. Like to best teachers told me Generic_Name and Generic_Name if you wright something on paper you will always be right or in the right path to do good on your book. Always need to wright your work what happens if you brake your computer but you have it on paper so your teacher can just grade your paper. Paper is the best way to get your work and plan it out because they are your opinions and computer it changes the words to what it wants to change it to. Next you need to be organized if your organized you can read your work fast and so can the teachers if your work is neater your can do it faster because you read it and if you don't have time to finish pages in your computer you can tarn the paper but not on the computer thing. Then if its organized you can use the same paper for next time but change some words or change the whole paper. you will need to do more work then just taring in the paper and not on the computer. Late you always need to be organized. After always finish you weighting dont leave it have way done just finish it to get done with the work you have to do because if you dont you will have to do way more work then what you have to get done just do your work on time. The end you will have to have everything done by the do date you have in school then you will do the rest of more work you have to get it done just do it.,human
"In some societies, some students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The courses of study in High School are selected to guide them toward a specific career. It would be amazing if students start when they enter High School. It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students.

First, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it would helps to develop more. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. They going to take things more serious for their life.

Secondly, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. For example, Generic_Name was a student from Generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was 17 years old. It was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes. But, she planned to get better lifestyle. She work really hard to complete what she want. By, Generic_Name start a career at a young age was the best option she did in her life, she have a lot of opportunity, she can work wherever she want to. Thus, start thing at a young age students would success more.

However, some people may argue that students should not be commit to a career at a young age because students would not enjoy High School. For example, people argue that students would be more incline about their career, and the would not enjoy High School as a teenager. However, start at a young age would be benefit for students because they would take High School as serious part of life. Also, students would have more opportunity in life, and they would develop more as a person.

To conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. But start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life. Students have the opportunity to be more successful in their careers. Sometimes would be hard for them to do double work, but as they focus and work hard, they would complete a lot in life. Start things at a young age always have good benefits for students and people in general.",human
"My thoughts on what author Ralph Waldo had wrote, is something I can agree with. The things i have experience and has made me the person I'am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person.

When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I started to get better and better, I was'nt struggling anymore. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didn't let him take them off. He told me that if don't take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i'd have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didn't take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn't afraid. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage.

Once you've done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. You are in this world to learn and grow. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he's just a worker at McDonald. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he's a hard worker. the manger realizes that he's got a big future ahead of him. Year's later, he's a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he's learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible.

Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone you'd never thought you could be. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. That's the point of growing. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.",human
"Imagine taking advice from two people, which person should you choose? Asking advice from two people is a hard digestion to make, but he will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

First, reason is he will know which advice to choose. He will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friend's advice because that is his gut feeling. He also knows if it's smart, or not. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head.

Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. For instance, if seeking advice from his mom ans his best friend he would choose his mom's advice. His mom has more experience. The older people are also wiser too.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because the person will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. In the future advice can change your life. It's difficult digestion to make, but when you seek multiple opinions you will choose the better choice.",human
"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",human

When considering the pros and cons of attending classes from home, there is no doubt that there are a variety of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it eliminates the need for physical attendance to classrooms, reduces the psychology of peer pressure, and eliminates potential health risks resulting from attending crowded places. In addition, students have the opportunity to arrange their learning environment according to their preferences and better manage their own time. On the other hand, there could be a lack of social interaction with classmates, a lack of guidance from instructors, and potential technical issues as well. 

However, in the end, the effect that home-based classes will have on learning is largely dependent on the situation of the student. For example, those who are already motivated to learn and are self-disciplined may reap the full benefits of studying in the comfort of their own home. Conversely, for those who require more interaction and guidance that comes with physical classrooms, a home-based learning style may not be as effective. 

Therefore, when it comes to allowing students the option to attend classes from home, there are intricacies that need to be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the best decision is made. Ultimately, this decision will depend on the individual student and their ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.",AI

One of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week. 

However, there are several potential drawbacks as well. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. 

Ultimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school. It is important to weigh both the potential cost savings and the potential negative effects of such a schedule in order to make an informed decision.",AI

Before making any decisions about getting involved in school activities, it is important to consult with your parents and have a clear understanding of how much time you can realistically dedicate to them. Participating in too many activities can impact your ability to focus on school work, which could result in poor grades. To ensure that parents are comfortable with the amount of activities that you are considering, have a meeting with the school to discuss the extracurricular activities and get parental feedback. Once everyone is on board, you can decide what activities are right for you, while keeping in mind your current workload.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined"". These inspiring words provide a valuable insight into the importance of pushing ourselves to strive for more in life. By pushing ourselves to push beyond our current level of mastery, there is more potential to grow and achieve our wildest dreams.

I have had many experiences in my life affirming this notion, particularly with regards to educational achievements. During my university years, I was often in situations where I had to push myself beyond what I knew I could do in order to get a desired result. For example, I recall a time when I had to work extra hard to manage a difficult assignment in a short time-frame. With a focused mindset and a strong work ethic, I surpassed my own expectations. In the end, I achieved a grade that I was proud of and as a result, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and growth.

Overall, pushing ourselves beyond what we have already mastered provides an invaluable opportunity to learn, experience, and create something that we may have thought was an impossibility. As Emerson said, by going confidently in the direction of our dreams, we are giving ourselves a chance to realize our full potential and to achieve amazing feats.",AI

Human character traits are shaped by a wide range of influences. Most notably, the early influences of parents, siblings, friends, and school can greatly impact the development of a person’s character traits. Parents, for example, can have a major influence on a child’s moral compass by providing consistent guidance and setting a positive example of how to act and treat others. Siblings can also be powerful models of behavior that have a significant impact on the development of character traits, particularly in the areas of cooperation, communication, and leadership. Friends can offer insights to beliefs, values, and lifestyles that can influence a person’s character traits. And, of course, schools can provide opportunities for academic growth, as well as the potential for exploring different intellectual pursuits, developing social skills, understanding cultural norms, and engaging in activities that can shape a person’s character traits. All of these influences serve to form and inform a person’s character traits, and so a better understanding of them can be advantageous.",AI

There is also evidence that online classes can foster student engagement as students are in control of when and how they access their education. Additionally, online classes make it easier for students to collaborate and communicate with one another in discussion forums or chat rooms. 

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to taking online classes. It can be difficult for students to motivate themselves when there is no professor present and no regular deadlines and expectations. Online classes also often lack the personal connections and relationships that come from face-to-face instruction. Furthermore, several studies have shown that students tend to be less successful in passing online classes than in traditional classroom courses.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to taking online classes, there are also disadvantages to consider. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to take online classes should be made on an individual basis, taking into account student engagement, difficulty of passing, and student-teacher relationships.",AI

No matter how hard we work or how much ambition and motivation we have, failure is as much a part of success as accomplishments. This is evidenced by the countless prominent successful individuals who have experienced numerous struggles on their path to success. For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. His famous quote, “sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. 

This essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. 

First, by looking at the lives of prominent successful individuals, we can see the role of failure in their success. From Elon Musk to Oprah Winfrey, there are countless stories of individuals who have failed on their paths to becoming global success stories. And not just small setbacks – individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. 

We can also look at the relationship between failure and success in our own lives. I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach. 

In conclusion, it is clear that failure can be a powerful stepping stone to success. Prominent successful individuals serve as examples of how mistakes can lead to great accomplishments. Furthermore, by reflecting on our own life experiences, we can understand the significance of failure in helping us grow and reach our goals. As such, it is crucial to embrace failure in any endeavor in order to reach true success.",AI

Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.” The main point of this quotation is that when we stay active and keep doing something, we can get things done. Staying active means staying focused on the goals we want to achieve. Making a plan to accomplish our goals and having the dedication to complete it can bring amazing results. 

On the other hand, when we are inactive and not accomplishing tasks, it can be detrimental to progress. If we are idle for too long and do not put effort into our goals, they may remain stagnant and we might miss out on opportunities. In addition, too much inactivity can lead to laziness, apathy and depression. 

Therefore, it’s important to evaluate both the pros and cons of always doing something and not doing something to accomplish goals. Doing something shows dedication and passion for our goals while doing nothing might make us miss out on important progress. When considering this quote, it’s important to strike a balance when pursuing our goals. By doing too much, we can exhaust ourselves and affect our mental and physical health. But when doing too little, it could affect our progress just the same. 

Overall, the quote “Determine never to be idle… It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing” by Thomas Jefferson is an inspiring reminder to stay active and move forward with our goals. It’s essential to be both active and restful in order to have balance and obtain our goals in life.",AI

My grandfather was a huge influence on my love for soccer. Growing up, I spent every Sunday after church with him watching soccer games on TV. The energy and passion of the crowds in the stadiums seemed to come alive through the television, and it was contagious. Grandpa taught me about teamwork, sportsmanship, and the rewards of hard work and self-discipline, and these things have stayed with me to this day. 

I have always wanted to visit Florida to get a full feel of its soccer culture. From the Orlando City Soccer Club to the Florida Cup, I would love to wander through the streets, checking out the soccer shops and meeting other soccer fans. Florida is also home to many of the USA’s best professional and college teams, and it would be a great opportunity to see the game at its highest level. 

My visits to Florida would be a great way to honor my grandfather’s memory and to celebrate the bond he and I shared over our shared love of soccer. No matter what, I know I will always fondly remember our Sunday afternoons together, cheering for our favorite teams and talking about the great players of the game. ",AI

Decision making plays a major role in one's life. It is important to understand the consequences of wrong decisions, and the benefits of making good choices. Making bad decisions can lead to disastrous results in people's personal lives, in the lives of their families, and even in their futures. For example, a person's reputation might be damaged, relationships might suffer, and future opportunities may be lost as a result of poor judgement.

Conversely, making good decisions brings a variety of positive outcomes. Good choices often lead to sound financial decisions, strong personal relationships, and increased self-confidence. In addition, good choices can help to ensure that one's future is safe and secure.

It is essential to make the right decisions in life. Understanding the possible consequences of wrong decisions and the benefits of making good choices can help guide a person in making decisions that will have positive results. It is important to consider the effects that one's choices will have on one's personal life, family, and future. Making good decisions is a key part of having a successful life.",AI

As I dug into the personal stories of successful people, one common theme stood out – their resilience in the face of failure. Whether it was Mark Zuckerburg learning to code after multiple failed attempts to launch a software company, or J.K. Rowling persisting despite rejection of her Harry Potter manuscripts, there’s something to be learned from their perseverance.   

I was reminded of my own experiences of coming up short and using those moments as a springboard for growth. As I processed these feelings, I was able to reflect on how failure has shaped me as a person and pushed me farther down the path that led me to success. 

I identified the ways that failure had contributed to my own growth and the impact it had on helping me reach my goals. I realized that to stay focused and motivated, it was important to create an environment that nurtured learning and positive self-belief. 

I was grateful for the support of my family and friends, who provided me with the encouragement and emotional support to stay the course. Through the combination of stumbling, finding solutions, and never giving up, I was able to take failure in stride, to ride the wave of success.",AI

In his essay ""Self-Reliance"", Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""The great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."" This statement captures the essence of the idea of being alone in the world – that is, one can be surrounded by people, yet remain independent and content despite the lack of connection with them.

Nevertheless, while Emerson's words might suggest that it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others, this idea is unrealistic in practice. Human beings rely on each other for countless things - whether it is emotional support, advice, or practical assistance in achieving something. In this sense, going it alone is rarely a viable option, and as such, it is difficult to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.

At the same time, this does not mean that it is impossible to do something meaningful alone. In fact, there are many examples of individuals who have made significant contributions without any sort of supportive network. One could argue that learning to rely on oneself could be a meaningful achievement in its own right. Therefore, while it is true that living a life without the help and support of others is more difficult, it is not impossible. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to determine whether it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.",AI

After much research and analysis, it is clear that adding an extra hour and a half to the school day can have both positive and negative implications for students, teachers, and their families. On one side, students would be able to gain more opportunities to have more class time to complete their coursework, have additional tutoring, and benefit from other extended educational experiences. On the other hand, studies suggest that increasing the school day could also lead to higher levels of stress for both students and teachers, increased behavioral issues in the classrooms, and less family time. Furthermore, if parents are not able to adjust their work hours to accommodate the extended school days, this could lead to further challenges for the students and potential childcare issues for the families. While the extra hour and a half of school time could provide additional educational opportunities, it is important to consider the balance of benefits and risks in order to make an informed decision.",AI

One of the most crucial components of personal well-being is self-esteem. Having strong self-esteem allows us to make balanced decisions, build meaningful relationships, and have a positive attitude toward life. It is important to recognize the role that praising and achieving can play in rising our self-esteem.

When we make an effort and receive positive praise, it can give us a great sense of accomplishment, leading to a boost in our self-esteem. It can make us feel appreciated and validated, reinforcing the belief that we are worthwhile and capable individuals. Similarly, when we attain a goal or an achievement, it can be extremely rewarding and can provide us with a great sense of pride.

The feeling of accomplishment that comes from praise and achievements can help cultivate and sustain our self-esteem, allowing us to face any future challenge with courage and optimism. Through this, we can become more confident in our potentials and be driven to continue to make an effort to reach our goals.

Therefore, it is essential to recognize and make use of the positive influences that praising and achievements can have on our self-esteem. By recognizing their potential impact, we can cultivate a strong sense of self-worth and appreciation for our unique abilities. This is essential for a healthy and balanced lifestyle.",AI

In Thomas Jefferson's words, ""Never be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" These words evoke an idea that is still relevant in society today - the importance of not being idle. With a global pandemic having affected much of our everyday life, it is more important than ever for young people to stay busy and productive.

Through Jefferson's words, young people are not only inspired to make use of their free time constructively but also strive to help others. With the current state of the world, we can come together by taking action to combat destructive idling. This could look like volunteering in local food banks, finding creative ways to engage with friends and family online, or even taking up a new hobby. No matter how big or small the contributions are, we can all do our part to not be idle.

Ultimately, Jefferson's words help us recognize the importance of not being idle and how it can both challenge and motivate us to strive to better our society. By using our time wisely, we can all come together and make a difference for future generations.",AI

One of the most beneficial educational activities is learning and practicing art. Engaging in art, whether it is drawing, painting, sculpting, or any other kind of creative endeavor, has many advantages that help us in both our personal and professional lives. It is well documented that engaging in creative activities such as art can reduce stress levels and promote an overall feeling of wellbeing. This is particularly important from a mental health standpoint, as we can often find ourselves dealing with anxiety and even depression due to various life experiences.

The skills and knowledge one can gain from an art-based education can also be incredibly useful in pursuing a career. There are many opportunities to explore in the art world, from becoming a professional artist or designer to different types of jobs in the industry, such as managing or marketing. It is becoming more important for people to possess a strong skillset that includes creative thinking. Art provides us with the opportunity to hone our creative skills and view the world in different ways. Moreover, people who go into a career related to art often cite their interest and experience from an early age, proving that art provides a valuable foundation to grow upon. 

Overall, engaging in art is an immensely enjoyable educational activity with tremendous potential to positively impact our lives. It provides numerous mental and physical benefits and can play an instrumental role in people finding their career paths and discovering their passions.",AI

We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect.",AI

The issue of whether or not school days should be extended beyond 8 hours is a controversial one that has generated widely differing opinions. On one hand, there are those who feel that longer school days would allow for more educational opportunities, while on the other, there are those who argue that it would lead to increased frustration and burnout among students. In this essay I will examine the argument that school days should not be extended beyond 8 hours, considering the impact this would have on students who have part-time jobs as well as the impact on their ability to participate in extra-curricular activities.",AI

Graduating from college in three years instead of four years is a great idea that should be considered by university administrators. Doing so would reduce the amount of time and money spent on education for students, allowing them to enter the workforce or pursue higher education much sooner. 

The idea of graduating college within a shorter period of time than four years is not a new concept. Some universities already offer three-year undergraduate programs, and these programs are successful and effective. Students are taking the same number of credits, taking advanced classes, and graduating at the same rate as those in four year degree programs. This demonstrates that graduating college in three years is not only feasible but also highly beneficial. 

For students looking to join the workforce after college quickly, three-year programs would help them start their careers sooner and begin making money. A bachelor’s degree takes time and money to acquire but having it in three years instead of four would make it more accessible to those for whom four-year degrees may not be feasible. Students would be able to access more opportunities with higher pay more quickly due to their accelerated timeline. The additional time would also give them the opportunity to pursue graduate studies or training for higher paying positions more quickly. 

In addition, three-year programs would be beneficial for universities by helping them save on money and resources. With more students completing their studies sooner, universities would save on housing, meals, tuition fees, and other expenses, allowing them to operate more efficiently. 

For all of these reasons, universities should consider allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four. It would be beneficial to everyone involved and would help ensure that everyone who wants to pursue a college degree is able to do so in a practical and efficient way.",AI

Growing up, my parents taught me to always stay humble and true to myself. This lesson has stayed with me my entire life and continues to shape my character. I have taken this humble nature and used it to help me keep my feet firmly on the ground in all of life's challenges. It helps me to stay self-aware and critically think through situations before acting rashly. 

However, I have also adopted traits from the people I admire most; traits that challenge me to push and take chances. This has helped me become more courageous, forceful, and passionate about my goals. While it may have been beneficial for me to take these on, I must be careful not to do so at the expense of my humble nature.

This brings me back to the idea of whether or not I truly have total control of my character. On the one hand, it feels as though I have fully embraced the traits my parents taught me and I am certainly making conscious decisions to adopt certain character traits from others. On the other hand, I can never truly know how my upbringing, environment, and even genetics have contributed to forming my character. All I know is that no matter what, I will continue to strive to be the best version of myself.",AI

When discussing the pros and cons of changing the school menu for the benefit of student health and academic performance, it is important to consider both sides. On one hand, providing students with healthy meals provides the essential nutrients and energy needed to focus in class and refrain from getting sick. Studies have shown that students who regularly eat healthful school lunches tend to have higher grade point averages and miss fewer days of school. For example, a study conducted at a high school in California found that students who ate school lunches had higher grades than those who brought their own.

On the other hand, changing the school menu may present more challenges than benefits. As schools transition to healthier options, students may not take the change positively, leading to lack of interest in the meals and potential food waste. Additionally, some students may require additional dietary accommodations that may not be available in the new menu. Furthermore, although healthier options can be more expensive, school budgets are limited. Having to pay for these meals could place an additional burden on students and families. Ultimately, the key is providing students with healthy options that are both delicious and affordable.",AI

When it comes to getting advice, it's often best to consult with multiple people. By having a variety of perspectives on a subject from different people, you can get a better idea of what the right decision is for you. People often seek advice on matters such as career paths, relationships, financial decisions, or life decisions. Hearing different perspectives from a range of people can be beneficial and help provide a comprehensive outlook. 

Furthermore, asking for advice is an opportunity to learn something new. People often bring up useful information that you may not have known previously. You might hear of new ideas and opportunities, or even be presented with tools and resources that can help you along the way. Asking for advice can also be a way to make new friends, as it helps foster meaningful conversations and relationships. 

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is well worth the effort. Gathering different perspectives can help you make more informed decisions, open up new avenues of learning, and create new relationships.",AI

    Curfews are laws or regulations that restrict the movement of teenagers in public places during certain hours of the day, usually at night. They are often instituted by governments or private organizations such as schools, in order to protect teenagers from engaging in risky or illegal behavior. 

Proponents of curfews argue that they reduce the likelihood of crime and that they can also act as a parental tool for monitoring their child's activities. On the other hand, opponents of curfews argue that restricting movement of young people unfairly interferes with their basic rights, and stifles creativity and personal development.

In some cases, curfews have been effective in curbing juvenile crime in particular areas. For example, in the city of Oakland, California, local officials observing a decrease in crime in areas where the curfew was introduced. On the other hand, there are also cases where curfews have had a detrimental impact on young people. For instance, in the United Kingdom, an 11pm curfew introduced during the coronavirus outbreak has had adverse effects on teenagers' mental health, with some feeling isolated and lonely due to the lack of social contact.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with curfews. It appears that curfews can be useful in keeping teenagers out of trouble in some cases, however, they can also interfere with their rights and limit their activities in other cases. The efficacy of curfews ultimately depends on the particular situation and context in which they are instituted.",AI

In Winston Churchill’s statement on the importance of failure, he argued that failure is crucial for individuals seeking success. Identifying with this idea, I think of a time in my life when I failed and subsequently achieved success: when I got a low grade on a maths test, I worked harder to properly understand the material and ultimately did well in the following tests. Similarly, I can think of a friend of mine who failed his first driving test, but worked to understand driver safety laws better, and passed the test the second time. In both of these cases, failure was necessary for success. In agreement with Churchill, I believe failure is an essential part of the process of achieving long-term success.",AI

John Lubbock's statement that one's character is chosen by oneself is widely accepted as one of the fundamental truths of life.

Throughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome. He said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. 

One example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. 

On a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.

In the end, it’s important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. As Michelangelo said, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise.",AI

First impressions can be deceiving, and sometimes it’s not until we know someone better that we realize their true character. Despite popular belief, these first impressions can be changed over time. 

One example of this comes from my own personal experience. My best friend in high school was someone I initially thought I had nothing in common with. We had completely different personalities and interests, so much so that we rarely shared a conversation, let alone became friends. Fast forward to college, and we’re now more like siblings than friends. Despite our different backgrounds – she was a first-generation immigrant from East Asia and I’m from a rural background halfway across the world – we’ve grown to understand each other and found areas of shared interest that have helped bond us closer than ever.

This is further supplemented by scientific evidence that supports the idea that first impressions can be changed. In a study conducted in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, it was found that one’s perception of another person can be modified with knowledge. This knowledge often comes in the form of connecting with shared interests or gaining a true understanding of the other person’s true character. This in turn allows for the development of a meaningful relationship that alters the initial perception of the other persons traits. 

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. This is evident in my own personal experience, as well as in various scientific studies that have been conducted. Understanding the true character of a person or gaining an understanding of shared interests has the potential to change the perception of a first impression, allowing for a strong connection.",AI

In today's world, the pressure of conformity is ever-increasing, making it important for individuals to stand out and embrace freedom of action and thought. Autonomy is fundamental for achieving a sense of self, as it allows one to explore and discover their own identity outside the scope of society's expectations. With the freedom to choose and act according to one's own desires, an individual can develop a sense of autonomy and self-assuredness that, in turn, can lead to personal growth.

As an example, consider someone who wishes to pursue their passions and dreams and find fulfillment in life. Having freedom of thought and action means this individual is free to explore these possibilities, free to make mistakes and learn from them, free to internalize new values and develop their own beliefs. These activities, when done with purpose, can help teach an individual valuable life lessons and increase their sense of identity, instilling within them the confidence to reach for greater heights.

It is clear that having freedom of action and thought is essential in a society that pressures conformity. Without it, an individual can easily be led away from their true identity because of external expectations. Thus, it is important to remain true to oneself and not be swayed by influences, and to continue to explore new ideas and opportunities in order to maximize personal growth.",AI

Online and video conferencing classes have become increasingly popular for students who are being homeschooled. Not only do these classes provide convenience, they also offer safety, improved focus, and the assurance of avoiding bad influences from others. 

Many parents who homeschool their children struggle to provide them in-person educational opportunities, especially with the already reduced resources available to homeschooled students. Online and video conferencing classes allow homeschooled students to access a variety of classes, often from the comfort and safety of their own home. This reduces the worrying parents often have about their children being exposed to bad influences outside of home. 

Additionally, online classes provide a level of focus that can be hard to replicate in a traditional classroom setting. Without the distractions of other students or teachers, the student is able to stay focused on the content and work more efficiently. When it comes to a homeschooled student, this concentrated form of learning is especially beneficial, as it can enhance their academic skills and levels of understanding.

When it comes to taking a break from the everyday grind of work and studies, having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school offer countless benefits. While some families may enjoy the structure that a yearly school schedule provides, the benefits of having longer school holidays and more frequent breaks can’t be overlooked. Taking a breather from work and studies provides an opportunity to relax and reset, relieving stress and allowing one to be more productive. 

For families, the options for vacation and activities are endless. From going to the pool or amusement park to having family movie night or picnicking in the park, each activity presents a unique opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other.

No matter how hard we try, it is impossible for us to have the exact same life experiences that someone else has had. Every single one of us has our own individual path through life that gives us a unique perspective of the world around us. While the circumstances that brought us to this moment are different, they have shaped us and created the people we are today. 

When it comes to living other people's experiences, the answer isn't a simple yes or no. We can empathize with someone else's story, and feel similar emotions as them. We might have the same emotion from a similar situation, even if it didn't happen to us, but it's never going to be the exact same. We may also observe and learn from the experiences of other people, and take what we learn and apply it in our own life. However, the experience won't be the exact same, since we haven't actually lived it first-hand. 

Ultimately, we have to create our own life experiences and explore what this world has to offer. While we can observe and learn from the experiences of others, we must also embrace our own journey through life and make the most of it. As the saying goes, “you’ll never know till you try”. While we can understand other people's life stories, we will never experience them in the same way. It's ok to take ideas or lessons from their experiences, but in the end, we all have to create our own unique path.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, ""In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."" This is a reminder to stop and think before we do something, for in doing so we open a wealth of possibilities that spark creativity and innovation. When it comes to financial decision-making, this is critical: taking the time to research and analyze the different options available is important in order to make the best choice. 

For example, when deciding whether to take out a loan for a house or a car, careful thoughts must be given in order to determine which option is the best. Additionally, investing in stocks or mutual funds must likewise be carefully considered since there is always a risk of losing money if the wrong financial decisions are made.

This concept of thinking before doing is equally applicable to other aspects of daily life. Before making a purchase, people can explore different ways of getting the item they need, such as looking for discounts and coupons or buying used. In relationships, it helps to take a step back and thoughtfully consider our feelings and actions before responding to difficult situations. In any scenario, taking the time to think before jumping into a decision leads to better outcomes.",AI

Every year, millions of people around the world exercise their right to elect their leaders through the democratic process. As citizens, it is our duty to understand the ins and outs of the election process to ensure that we make informed decisions. Similarly, it is important to have an understanding of JROTC and similar military-like programs. Knowing the pros and cons of these great programs can help us better decide if they are right for us.

We can also look to many successful people for guidance and motivation when trying to reach our career goals. Researching these stories and seeing how they achieved their goals can be very beneficial in our own pursuits. Along the same line, it is important to understand the impact of planning in our lives, and take time to come up with a plan that will guide us towards our desired objective.

Finally, obtaining experience in the field is essential if you want to understand it and eventually work in it. Taking the time to make sure you are properly informed and well-experienced can make all the difference. All in all, by doing your research and taking the time to consider your plan for the future, you can be well on your way to acquiring the job you intended to work for.",AI

    When it comes to seeking advice or opinions, it is always beneficial to consult more than one person. Consulting multiple sources of knowledge and experience can provide different perspectives and better inform the decision-making process. Additionally, relying on a more diverse base of sources can help to mitigate the risk of bias and reduce the possibility of making a bad decision. On the other hand, if advice is only being sought from a single source, they may lack the breadth of knowledge needed. Furthermore, the advice from one single person also contains the potential of being biased, as they may have their own personal agenda and motivations.

Recently, I was considering starting my own business and needed some advice. I decided to ask family members, friends, and colleagues who had been successful entrepreneurs and gathered their advice based on their experiences. After taking the time to listen to everyone’s opinion, I was able to make a more informed and well-rounded decision on which path to pursue.",AI

Failure is an important yet often uncomfortable part of life. It can cause a decrease of hope, enthusiasm and faith and make people feel like their efforts are futile. However, failure can also be used to motivate people to succeed. By understanding the mistakes made and reflecting on how to do better in the future, we can build up our resilience and prepare for future challenges. 

For instance, a student who has failed a test may take time to analyze the mistakes they made and use this to focus their future efforts. This forward-thinking can help the student develop the persistence and determination to succeed. However, success does not always come from failing. It is important to strive for success on the path up to it, as well as learn the lessons from mistakes along the way. Successful results can come from being diligent and methodical in any endeavor.",AI

In the 21st century, technology has drastically changed the way humans communicate and interact with each other. Access to laptops, tablets, and smartphones have made it easier and faster to communicate with others, which has proven to be both a positive and a negative aspect of technology. On one hand, communication has become more efficient with the ability to instantly get in touch with anyone, anytime. On the other hand, spending too much time on technology can lead to reduced social interaction and even vision problems, due to the reliance on screens. 

Additionally, technology has had a major impact on libraries and their role in society. As the majority of people now have access to digital books and other forms of media on the internet, fewer people visit libraries. Librarians have had to adapt to this changing trend and redirect their attention to providing other services such as educational programs, or hosting events like music performances.

Considering the negative effects of increased technology usage, it is important to limit the time spent on technology and find a healthy balance. It can be helpful to set boundaries and limit the amount of time spent on screens daily. Additionally, we should give ourselves the chance to connect with others face to face, as meaningful interactions are fundamental for our social development.",AI

Having a good attitude in life is strongly associated to success and resilience when facing challenging situations. Studies have shown that having a positive outlook on life can help us overcome adversity, and can ultimately lead to success. It increases our capabilities to see opportunity, rather than danger, in the face of failure. Moreover, research has shown that having a positive attitude can make it easier to focus on tasks and circumvent negative emotions. Positive thinking makes it easier to view a problem as a challenge, instead of an obstacle. 

Despite these advantages, there is a debate about whether having a positive attitude is necessary for success. There is evidence that hard work, resilience, and talent are all equally important to attaining success. Nonetheless, having a positive attitude in life greatly increases the chances of achieving both short-term goals and long-term objectives.

In today's world, it is of paramount importance to continue to learn new skills and information, both for success and personal growth. Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the significance of this by noting, “Life is a journey, not a destination.” His message is that knowledge is obtained through the journey of life, and only through continual learning can one reach their goals. 

This concept is evident in everyday life. For example, individuals from all walks of life may take a class to learn a new skill, such as a coding language or baking. By engaging in such activities, people are able to gain knowledge while also expanding their interests and gaining insight into what they enjoy.

Education is key when it comes to discovering new passions. Researchers have long noted the importance of education in discovering new interests and hobbies. Studies have found that the more time individuals spend with their studies, the more likely they are to discover talents and interests they were previously unaware of. Furthermore, it is these activities one learns through their studies that eventually lead to a career or pursuit one is passionate about.

Therefore, it is essential to continuously push yourself further in life, despite what you have already accomplished. By engaging in learning activities, individuals not only prevent stagnation, but also open themselves to a variety of opportunities that can lead to personal growth and success.",AI

In a world of constant pressure to conform, it can be difficult to truly be oneself. Our society is constantly trying to change us, to mold us into the people that it prefers. But is this a successful pursuit? Ultimately, is the greatest accomplishment in the world being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are?

To understand the answer to this question, it is important to look at the meaning behind being oneself. Being oneself is more than just the physical attributes that make up a person’s identity. It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. Being able to stand up for one’s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.

It takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. In addition, it can be educational and inspiring to those that may follow a similar path. It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.

At the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. To understand and accept oneself is a powerful thing, and it should be recognized and its power should be recognized. The greatest accomplishment in the world can be being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are.",AI

In my opinion, extending the school day by one and a half hours is a bad idea. The additional time would place an undue burden on students, drivers, and teachers. For students, the extra time spent in the classroom would leave less time for homework, activities, and family time; all of which contribute to physical and mental health. For drivers, it would mean more kids on the road during rush hour, potentially leading to dangerous situations and delays. Finally, for teachers, it would mean longer days with more lesson plans to create and teach. 

All in all, I think that extending the school day is not a good idea. It could lead to dangerous and negative situations for students, drivers, and teachers alike. There are better ways to improve education that don't rely on cutting into the precious time students have for other activities.",AI

My first impression of someone may not be particularly accurate. Societal norms and expectations, personal biases, or even the way someone is dressed can all affect our initial opinion. It is impossible to get a full perspective of someone’s character, personality, or values just by first impressions. People can be much more complex than we give them credit for, and sometimes it takes a second, or even a third, look to get a better idea of who they are. 

Although first impressions can be helpful in some situations, forming too strong of an opinion or judgement based off of minimal information can be hazardous. People should take their own time in getting to know someone's decency, intelligence, and overall character before assuming they shaped the complete, accurate picture. 

Overall, it is a mistake to think that our first impressions are the most important when getting to know somebody. We should leave room for change, understanding, and growth in getting to know someone, and not rely solely on surface-level features.",AI

When faced with the expectations of society and family, it can be easy to lose sight of yourself in the process. In today’s world, it is increasingly important to stay true to yourself, no matter how much pressure is applied. Being true to yourself has the potential to provide numerous benefits, such as improved overall well-being and a sense of personal meaning. 

When you remain true to yourself, even when it conflicts with external influences, you will be able to feel more confident and in control of your life. You will find yourself surrounded by people that accept and respect you for who you are. You will find that when you stand up for yourself and refuse to compromise who you are for the sake of others, you will experience a newfound sense of self-empowerment. 

It is understandable to feel caught between the expectations of society and family. It can be overwhelming to know that you're constantly being judged and pressurized. The choices we make in such situations can be difficult, but it is important to remember that in the end, your sense of self is what really matters. If you stay true to your identity and goals in life, you will be able to live your best life.

Distance learning and attending classes at school both have their benefits and drawbacks.  Distance learning, such as online coursework, can allow for more flexibility in terms of when and where instruction is completed. It can also allow students to engage with course material on their own terms, taking more or less time as needed for understanding. However, online courses are often more self-directed, and as such may require that students have strong self-discipline or adequate support to ensure that the material is correctly completed.

Attending classes at school still offers its advantages, such as personal engagement with teachers and peers, as well as having fixed end-points to curriculum: namely semesters or quarters. In the classroom, teachers are available to help guide students with any issues they encounter, and the structure of the classroom serves to facilitate focus on mastering material. That said, the physical limitations of attending classes can also paint a challenge for students who have to work around a set school schedule, and who may not always be able to attend or complete their coursework in-person.

In conclusion, there are advantages and drawbacks to each system of learning—distance learning can offer more freedom in terms of when and how to engage with course material, while attending classes can offer more structure and personal connection with a teacher. Ultimately, the choice of system may depend on an individual's personal needs and learning style.",AI

Imagination can provide a solution to the unanswerable, can turn obstacles into opportunities, and can create a path where none existed before. Imagination is essential, both in our personal as well as our professional lives, because it enables us to cast aside the limits of knowledge and see the bigger picture.

Take, for instance, a young child. Children are able to use their imagination in amazing ways, to conjure up stories, pictures or objects of their own making. Parents and educators often praise this sort of creative thinking, as it allows the child to take risks free from the anxiety of being wrong. 

More importantly, imagination can be used to bridge gaps for the differently-abled. For the blind, for example, it is not knowledge that might help a person find his or her way, but rather the ability to imagine one's surroundings. It is imagination that allows them to visualise a street corner or a store, and to traverse a path that may have been previously unknown. 

In conclusion, imagination is considered more important than knowledge because it is far more versatile, powerful, and adaptive. It is the tool we need when knowledge fails us; it is the key to creative thinking; and it allows for a measure of flexibility and creativity that knowledge alone cannot offer.",AI

When it comes to making decisions, many of us grapple with the question of whether to go it alone or to seek guidance from those more experienced.  On the one hand, seeking professional advice can provide us with the specialized expertise necessary to tackle complicated situations.  On the other hand, making one’s own decisions can provide a sense of independence and self-ownership.  

For me, I value both my liberty and security.  I value my freedom to be independent and make decisions that reflect my own interests, and I also recognize the importance of maintaining a sense of safety and stability. As such, it’s important for me to strike a balance between trusting my instincts and trusting the wisdom of experts.

Making one’s own decisions is particularly important when it comes to matters of personal values.  No one knows me better than I know myself, so I’m well aware of the values and life matters that are most important to me.  With that being said, when it comes to more complicated or technical matters, I believe it's wise to seek counsel from professionals to ensure I make the best possible decisions.

In the end, it's up to me to choose between making my own decisions or seeking expert guidance.

Seeking advice from trusted sources when making important decisions is a wise course of action. I have personally sought and followed advice that has yielded both good and bad results, providing me with valuable insight on why it should be sought. 

The first reason why advice should be sought is that it can provide different perspectives. When I was choosing which college to attend, I sought advice from my parents, my teachers, and peers, which gave me many different opinions and viewpoints on the best choice. Each individual had different experiences and advice that helped me make a better decision.

The second reason why advice should be sought is to get guidance on difficult decisions. For example, when deciding whether to start my own business, I asked financial advisors, mentors, and entrepreneurs who had extensive knowledge and experience in the field. Their advice on both the risks and potential rewards of launching my own business helped to inform my decision.

The third reason why advice should be sought is to get help developing plans and strategies. Before embarking on a big project, I often consult other people who have done similar projects before. Their advice has proved invaluable in helping me plan out a step-by-step process for success.

Learning how to deal with stressful situations and difficult problems can be hard. However, it is essential in order to face and solve them in a productive and healthy way. 

Here are some tips and advice on how to face and solve problems:

- Take a step back and assess the situation objectively—gaining a better understanding of the problem can help define the steps needed to fix it.
- Break the problem into smaller steps—accomplishing smaller tasks can be less overwhelming and lead to the bigger picture. 
- Ask for help—telling a friend or family member about a problem can help to ease the burden and create a plan of action.

For example, being bullied is a difficult life problem that can be solved. It’s important to talk to a trusted adult like a teacher, parent, or guidance counselor to address the issue. If the problem is already out of hand, consider contacting the authorities for help. 

Facing and solving this problem can have many beneficial outcomes. It can bring an increased sense of self-confidence and self- worth, to know that the problem has been handled and no longer has control over your life. It can also provide a newfound appreciation for the people that supported you and helped to end the bullying. 

It is essential to tell a friend or family about a problem in order to be met with support and helpful advice.

After researching the potential impact of shortening the duration of public high school from four years to three, it is clear that there could be both advantages and disadvantages of such a change. On the positive side, a three-year program could give students the opportunity to enter college or the workforce one year earlier than those in a four-year program, allowing them to fast-track their educational or career pursuits. However, it could also alienate those who would have otherwise benefitted from an additional year of high school, such as those looking to improve their academic scores or those needing an extra year to acclimate to the pre-university or employment environment.

Ultimately, the decision to pursue three years of high school should take into account several other factors. These could include students’ academic readiness levels, the availability of extracurriculars and support services, and the larger socio-economic environment that will affect a student’s educational and career prospects. Based on these considerations, it is clear that every individual must evaluate the risks and benefits of a three-year high school program against their own personal circumstances, and the potential impact of the decision on their future success.",AI

When it comes to schools having local partnerships, there are various risks and rewards involved. On one hand, schools can benefit from the expertise and resources that companies bring to the table. They can also provide students with a better understanding of the industry and potential career paths they can explore. On the other hand, this collaboration requires communication, trust, and a lot of effort to ensure that both parties come away with a positive outcome. 

Challenges that come with forming partnerships can range from not understanding the company's values and goals, to different levels of commitment between schools and businesses. On the other hand, benefits of collaboration can include access to mentors and resources, project-based learning opportunities, and more diverse classroom learning experiences. 

Successful businesses with local partnerships often create positive, lasting changes within their communities. For example, schools with strong business partnerships may have access to new technologies, mentors, and community resources. This can help students stay engaged in their studies and equip them with the skills they need to succeed. Additionally, these partnerships can open doors for students, offering internships and job prospects, while helping the community grow in the process. 

Through careful consideration and thoughtful partnerships, schools have the potential to become a much needed source of hope and opportunity for students. The risks and rewards of having a partnership with a local company should be carefully weighed out in order to maximize the benefits for students. By exploring these implications and establishing strategies that help students succeed, schools can create an environment that helps young adults to reach their highest potential.",AI

Studies show there are many benefits to reducing time spent in high school. For students, the exertion of taking multiple classes can often be mentally and physically draining, making it difficult to stay motivated and engaged. Reducing a student's course load in high school allows them more time to focus and invest in activities outside of the classroom that broaden their educational experiences. 

In the United States, there are multiple national programs that offer students the opportunity to reduce their time spent in high school. The Department of Education has implemented initiatives like the Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate Program to allow students the chance to obtain high school credits at a faster pace. Additionally, many states have implemented dual enrollment programs for high school students to take college classes with the potential for credit. 

The advantages of programs such as these are multifold. These initiatives provide students the opportunity to take classes in high school that they would otherwise not have the chance to experience. They also allow students the capacity to further develop their interest in particular subjects, by allowing them to have a more expansive learning experience. Finally, programs such as these may reduce the cost of attending college by reducing the amount of course credits needed for graduation. 

In conclusion, there are many ways in which students can reduce their time spent in high school. Through a variety of national programs, students have the opportunity to take classes that aid in their academic development and provide them with opportunities to explore different academic interests. Ultimately, reducing time spent in high school can lead to personal growth, educational experiences, and economic benefits.",AI

When it comes to achieving success in life, school, work and sports, there is an old adage that you can go from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. This means that it is possible to be resilient to failure and to continuously persist in the pursuit of our goals. 

Enthusiasm is often overlooked as a vital ingredient to our success, but it can be a powerful motivator. It can give us the hope and courage to continue on our journey, despite the hardships and setbacks that we may face. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious. If we can tap into this positivity and spread it to those around us, we can help to inspire and motivate them to do the same. 

By never allowing ourselves to be discouraged by failure and instead projecting enthusiasm and optimism, we can find the strength and motivation to keep pressing forward on our path to success.",AI

Self-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others. Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in their ability to complete a task, may receive praise from an adult for their progress thus far. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator for the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in their mission. It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential. 
 
Adults have an important opportunity to provide affirmation to younger individuals to support and build self-esteem. Through providing these positive affirmations, adults have the privilege of creating an encouraging atmosphere, a sense of security, and a safe environment to learn and grow.",AI

Recent studies on the effects of distance learning on students' learning outcomes have shown both pros and cons. On one hand, students who attend classes from home are able to learn in an environment that is tailored to their own individual learning styles. This can provide a more engaging learning experience compared to traditional classrooms, as students are in charge of their own learning pace and environment. 

However, students attending classes from home can suffer from issues concerning socialization, responsibility, and experience. Without face-to-face communication, many important learning and life skills such as team work, public speaking, and interpersonal communication are lost. Also, there is comparatively a lack of responsibility and guidance for progress when in an online setting.

Overall, the future of distance learning for students remains, at the very least, uncertain. For those who struggle to learn in a traditional setting, distance learning can provide a great alternative. Equally, traditional classrooms are still preferred by some for a number of reasons, such as social connection and assessment feedback. It is important that students are given the option to choose between the two learning methods in order to create an ideal learning environment.",AI

Education has a profound impact on both individual economic and social outcomes and global economic and social conditions. Education can provide individuals with opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the workforce, thereby improving their individual economic prospects. It can also empower people to have a greater voice in their communities and participate more fully in their societies. Additionally, education can have a positive impact on global economic and social outcomes by creating a more educated and productive workforce.

When it comes to accessing higher education, there are a number of different approaches. Governments can offer student loans, scholarships, and grants to make higher education more accessible. Private companies, nonprofits, and other organizations can also step in to provide financing for students or establish scholarships for underserved communities. Additionally, students can use crowdfunding to raise money for their educations, or take on part-time or full-time jobs to cover tuition costs.

There are many examples of educational efforts that have been successful in promoting economic development or reducing poverty. For instance, in India, the government launched a program to provide free laptops and internet access to economically disadvantaged students, which has resulted in a reduction in poverty in the region. In Tanzania, a program to train teachers in the use of technology has enabled students to access online courses and educational resources that otherwise would not have been available.

In order to make higher education more accessible, governments and other organizations need to create policies and programs that focus on reducing the financial barriers that prevent individuals from attending college. This could include providing more financial aid, expanding student loan and grant programs, and providing tax credits to those who pay tuition. Additionally, more needs to be done to fund and support initiatives that help students access the resources they need to complete their education. 

Finally, education can be used as a tool to create economic opportunities for people. Individuals can use their education to start businesses and develop products that will benefit their communities and economies. Education can also help to increase the productivity of businesses, as workers can use their skills and knowledge to increase efficiency and lower costs. In this way, education can be a powerful tool for reducing poverty and promoting economic development.",AI

Taking a four-day weekend can have a positive impact on both mental and physical health. Researchers have found that taking a break, even for a few days, can help to refuel and refresh the mind and body. For one, having an extended weekend can help to reduce stress levels from the daily pressures of work and life. This can help to restore a feeling of calm and balance which can be beneficial for physical health. Moreover, having the extra day can allow us to engage in activities we don’t otherwise have time for such as socializing with family and friends, taking the time to relax, or doing something for self-care. 

Furthermore, having a four-day weekend can have many benefits for schools, the environment, employers, and employees. For schools, it could grant students an additional day to get organized, study, or attend tutoring. Additionally, it could provide a unique opportunity for field trips or use the day for special programming. For the environment, having an extra day off could reduce fossil fuel emissions and lead to a cleaner environment. Employers and employees could also benefit from having the extra day to rest and recoup. Additionally, employers might be able to save on operational costs if the business is closed for the additional day. 

In conclusion, taking a four-day weekend can be beneficial for overall mental and physical health, schools, the environment, employers, and employees. ",AI

Technology has become an integral part of our lives, both in the workplace and in our personal lives. While the advances made possible by technology have been beneficial for many, they have also made it easier for us to become over-reliant on digital resources and lose our natural connection with people and our environment.

One of the biggest dangers of technology is its potential to negatively affect our physical and mental health. Prolonged exposure to blue light emitted by electronic devices can disrupt our natural circadian rhythms, causing a range of issues including insomnia, fatigue, and mood disturbances. Additionally, too much time spent on devices is linked to an increase in feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress.

Technology can also impact our personal relationships. The prevalence of social media sites and messaging apps has given our phone screens priority over in-person interactions, preventing us from developing deeper connections with those closest to us.

Fortunately, technology does have the potential to be used responsibly. Limiting our exposure to blue light by avoiding screens at night, and keeping dedicated tech-free time is one way to ensure technology has limited negative impacts. Additionally, setting boundaries for yourself with regard to social media use can help foster healthier relationships. By recognizing the potential risks of technology and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure technology continues to be an asset to our lives.",AI

Research has shown that there are numerous benefits to providing healthier food options in school cafeterias. Studies have found that students who eat healthier, balanced meals during the school day perform better in class, have higher cognitive functioning, and feel more energized and ready to learn. Furthermore, introducing healthier snacks such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and alternative grains can help counteract the effects of processed and sugary snacks that are popular amongst students. 

To effectively implement healthier food options in school cafeterias, the following steps should be taken: 

1. Conduct an audit of the current food items offered in the school lunchroom. 
2. Survey the students to learn their preferences for healthy snacks. 
3. Introduce nutritious whole foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, seeds, and nuts, as well as plant-based substitutes to traditional lunch items. 
4. Educate the students on the importance of making healthier food choices. 
5. Set aside time for students to participate in activities that promote healthy eating habits.

Seeking advice from one person when making important life decisions can be an effective approach when that person possesses expertise in the area. Having one opinion can also help to keep the decision-making process more organized and straightforward. On the other hand, consulting only one person for an important decision may limit the breadth of perspectives on the issue and may ignore information gaps that multiple perspectives could fill. Additionally, relying on the opinion of one person could increase the risk of bias when such a person has a personal interest in the decision being made. 

Getting advice from multiple people when making an important life decision can provide valuable insight into the issue and may help to capture a variety of perspectives. Additionally, this approach may reduce the risk of bias due to the larger source pool of advice. The downside of using multiple people as sources of advice is that it can be difficult to manage an opinion from a large group and can be less efficient than relying on the counsel of a single source.",AI

According to research, students typically receive far more break time throughout the school year than non-student adults. A 3-4 week break in the summer offers students time to relax and recharge, but it can also put them behind in their academic studies when school re-starts. Similarly, a longer winter break may give students more time to prepare for upcoming exams, but some may neglect their studies over the holidays. Spring and fall breaks provide a nice balance between the short summer break and the longer winter break, giving students a week to rest and reset midway through the academic year. 

Students who use the summer break to their advantage can set goals such as gaining professional experience by securing a full-time job or saving money for college. This helps them to prepare for the future, as well as establish a sense of responsibility and independence. This can in turn have a significant impact on their long-term success and the skills they gain over summer breaks can help to make them even more attractive to future employers.",AI

The debate over the potential pros and cons of switching to a four-day, ten-hour school week has been raging for some time. Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.

In terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.

On the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness. Additionally, it could cause them to lose valuable time with friends and affect their social development.

Ultimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. It is important for administrators to keep in mind that an effective school day should provide students with a balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and should ensure that their physical and mental health are both taken into account.",AI

Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use. Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion. 

Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.

Failure often has a negative connotation attached to it, but this statement speaks to the importance of failure in one’s journey to success. Success is not an end-goal that can be achieved in one stroke of genius, but rather an ongoing adventure punctuated by failures that help shape our progress. Failure can teach us valuable lessons about ourselves and our experiences, and serves to refine our methods and approaches to better facilitate our success. Understanding this makes failure less daunting and more a necessary part of the equation to success. 

It is also critical to have an enthusiastic mindset towards failure, for it allows us to reflect and analyze our mistakes without letting them bog us down. More often than not, our failures point us in the direction of success and provide us with the knowledge and experience we need to finish the journey. For without failure, we would remain in a state of comfortable mediocrity, never pushing ourselves beyond our limits to see our true potential.

Programs that bring older and younger students together in the same school can be a powerful tool for education and collaboration. Older students provide insight into more advanced topics and can serve as mentors for younger students as they learn new skills. Younger students, meanwhile, can provide enthusiasm and energy as well as fresh perspectives for the older students. This exchange of ideas and expertise can be very beneficial.

When planning and implementing a program between students of different ages, it is important to consider the different levels of responsibility between the two groups. For example, older students may need to assume additional leadership roles, while younger students may need additional guidance and direction. This can be beneficial in fostering mutual respect and building skills, such as problem solving and communication.

The school board's newly implemented decision to add one and a half hours to the school day would be detrimental to the overall physical and mental wellbeing of students. For starters, I would have to sacrifice time that I need for sleep in order to meet the new demands of this extended school day. Not only do I require a healthy amount of sleep to keep up with the demands of my current curriculum, but I have the added stress of my extracurricular activities to juggle alongside. The extended school day would leave me with absolutely no time to pursue any hobbies or projects outside of school.

In addition, due to the excessive amount of time spent in school each day I would not be able to effectively dedicate enough resources to each subject. In consequence of this, the overall quality of learning that I receive would be drastically reduced. Seven hours of school is the international average for the amount of time required by students to fully learn the material in an effective and concise fashion.

In most cases, it is simply naive to believe that ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Problems require both time and energy to solve, making them a significant challenge to conquer. As such, it is not always easy for an individual to perform optimally when faced with a problem. Consider the example of someone who has been struggling with an addiction for many years. Despite the many challenges and hardships that have been faced, this individual has failed to make progress in overcoming their problem. This situation clearly demonstrates that simply labelling a problem as an opportunity to do one's best is not an effective solution.

Furthermore, some individuals acquire a bad habit of repeating the same mistakes over and over again. This repetition prevents them from growing and developing as a person, and can cause them to be stuck in a stagnant pattern of behavior. When a person is failing to learn from their mistakes, it is highly unlikely that they could adequately address a new problem using their best efforts.

Though some may argue that facing a problem is beneficial, as it allows one to be proactive and seek assistance from the resources needed to solve the problem, this has the potential to come at a cost. For some individuals, the consequences of their current problems may be too great for them to handle. They may have to confront the difficult consequences of the problem, with no ability to perform at their best to address the issue.

Therefore, it is evident that ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" is not always a sound philosophy. The best way to succeed in life is often by making fewer mistakes, rather than relying on the ""chance"" to do your best when presented with a problem.",AI

First impressions are incredibly important in the formation of relationships and opinions of people and events. They can shape the way we view the people, places, and cultures around us. Throughout my life, I have both experienced and seen first impressions that are hard to overcome. For example, I remember going to a new school and having my first impressions of the other students being based on what they wore, the things they said, and their general attitude towards the other students. Sadly, these initial, often inaccurate, impressions would remain with me for some time. 

Incidentally, this is backed up by research which suggests that first impressions are made quickly, often in less than a few seconds, and are difficult to later change. It's even been shown that first impressions are made primarily using visual cues such as clothing, hairstyles, body language, and facial expressions. While some first impressions are accurate in predicting how people will behave, many times they are not, which is why it's so important to be aware of them. 

By being aware of first impressions, we can make sure that we don't unnecessarily limit our relationships and interactions with other people based on these first impressions. It's also important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and making snap judgments about someone could lead to misdirected opinions and misunderstandings of the person in question. In essence, first impressions are a powerful tool that can shape our opinions of an individual or situation, but it's important to remember that these first impressions can be wrong.",AI

The idea of a four-day work week with ten hour days is gaining traction in the business world - and for good reason. Many studies suggest that this type of schedule can maximize productivity and energy levels while reducing fatigue and increasing employee satisfaction. In terms of energy use, the compact time frame of this type of arrangement means that less energy is consumed overall. In addition, employees often report feeling more motivated and refreshed due to the additional day off. This can increase productivity, as employees have more time to rest and recharge. While the five day work week is the more traditional option, the four day work week with ten hour days has the potential to bring benefits to both the employer and the employee.",AI

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be incredibly useful for making sound decisions, while also being susceptible to bias and personal preference. On the other hand, deciding for oneself without outside guidance allows for full autonomy and the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. There are many stories of people who have achieved success by following their own decisions, regardless of what society or authority figures told them to do. It is important to learn from one's own mistakes so that they may continue to improve and grow. Without ever making your own decisions and taking your own risks, you miss out on invaluable learning experiences. The difference between making mistakes and learning from them is understanding why the mistake was made, and recognizing why it should not be made again. Failing to recognize why the mistake was made means the mistake could be made again, and true growth is not achieved.",AI

Albert Einstein famously said “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.” This statement speaks to the power of imagination and its ability to stretch beyond circumstances and possibilitites of the physical. Knowledge may guide us through life, but imagination can help us envision a better world. 

For instance, the technological advances of the 20th century would have been impossible if it hadn’t been for the imaginations of inventors like Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Without their vision, we wouldn’t have access to lightning-fast communication and other tools that rely upon the power of imagination.

Imagination can also be credited with our ability to progress culturally and spiritually. When we embrace imagination, it helps us envision paths to personal growth and transformation. It can constantly inspire us to think bigger and better, to uncover new insights and explore our own potential. 

In many respects, imagination is the tool with which we build the future. It is more important than knowledge because it enables us to find creative solutions to our problems, build upon our wins, and become wiser as a collective. Without it, our ambition to learn and grow our potential would be limited. 

Ultimately, imagination is more important than knowledge because it is the spark that triggers creativity, discovery, and progress. It allows us to reshape our reality and pursue a better tomorrow. Through our imagination, we can rewrite the rules and design the future.",AI

It is important to consider alternative extracurricular activities to the more commonly known activities such as sports, yearbook making, and student counciling. Activities such as art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer studies, science, math, reading, and writing have many benefits, such as fostering creativity, teaching valuable skills, and expanding a student’s knowledge. However, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well, such as potential distractions or lack of recognition. It is also important to understand the opinions of students who do not wish to participate in any of the extracurricular activities. Therefore, a recommendation for the principal should include a variety of extracurricular activities, including activities that can allow for creativity, such as art and music. Furthermore, there should be activities that provide an opportunity for students to learn valuable skills, such as computer studies and chess club.

Thomas Jefferson was the third president of the United States and one of the Founding Fathers of the nation. He led a remarkable life full of impressive accomplishments that exemplify the principle of “doing work always”. The founding of the University of Virginia, for example, was a testament to the less popular slogan, “never tire of doing work”. Jefferson’s unwavering diligence shaped the future of education in the United States and set an example for generations to come. 

This idea of “doing work always” has benefitted many people throughout history, from famous politicians to humble citizens. Throughout Jefferson’s lifetime, the hardworking people around him believed that “working hard” was the surest path to achieving success. Similarly, hard work has played an important role in inspiring the success of countless individuals, from 19th century poet Walt Whitman to modern-day entrepreneur Steve Jobs, revealing the power of “doing work always”. 
 
In contrast, the consequences of “not doing work always” can have negative effects on individuals and society. On the individual level, a lack of hard work can prevent us from achieving our goals and lead to stagnation and dissatisfaction with life. On the society level, it can lead to lack of innovation and progress, which can be especially problematic in a rapidly-evolving world. 

Personally, I have seen the impact of “doing work always” firsthand. It has been the cornerstone of my education and career, continually pushing me to reach higher and try harder. I have experienced countless successes, all highlighting the power of “doing work always” and the amazing things that can be accomplished through hard work and dedication.",AI

I recently had a personal experience that once again reminded me of the power of a positive attitude to lead us to success. I was completely overwhelmed by a seemingly insurmountable challenge that had been set before me: to build a complex website in a very short amount of time. I felt defeated before even beginning and was convinced the project was doomed. 

But then something shifted and I decided to take a different approach. I remembered a quote that said, “A positive attitude can create mountains out of molehills.” So I decided to challenge myself to have a positive attitude during the entire process. I made myself smile even when things were hardest and kept positive affirmations in my mind throughout. As a result, I was able to complete the project not only on time, but in half the amount of time I originally anticipated.

This was a life-changing moment for me. I realized the value in maintaining a positive attitude no matter how difficult the situation. From that day forward, I decided to always keep a positive attitude in life no matter what I am doing. Not only does it help me stay motivated and feel better, but I have seen first-hand how it can contribute to my success. 

Through experience, I now know that having a positive attitude can often times make the difference between success and failure. It has the power to not only reduce the difficulty of the task at hand, but also to act as a beacon of hope that illuminates a path for achieving our goals.",AI

As students grow up they are encouraged to plan for their future, and this often starts with considering a career choice at a young age. Deciding on a career path can be an important and empowering process, and there are several benefits to this. It can lead to more purposeful learning when young students are aware of the relevance of what they are learning in relation to their chosen career. Also, if students know of a career they would like to pursue, they are likely to be more engaged in planning for their future and have a heightened awareness of the value of their school experience in this regard. 

On the other hand, making decisions about their future at a young age can be overwhelming for students as they are not yet fully aware of the range of possibilities available to them. Decisions made at this time in life can too easily become rigid and inflexible. Furthermore, since young students may not have experienced a breadth of different options, their decisions may be rooted more in a romanticized viewing of a potential job than in reality.

In summary, although there are benefits to young students starting to think about their future career, it is important to ensure that decisions made at such a young age do not limit the student’s options and remain open to change and new possibilities.",AI

One's character traits are often strongly influenced by the people we communicate with and the environment in which we live. For example, growing up I had a close friend who was very outgoing and adventurous. Spending time with them often pushed me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take on new challenges. Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life. 

To illustrate this point, one of my relatives grew up in an environment where she was surrounded by art, music, and books. At a young age her parents exposed her to various forms of creative expression and provided her with the necessary resources and tools to be creative. As a result, she grew up to be very artistic and proficient in multiple instruments. This would have not been the case had she not been exposed to the various forms of art and creativity in her childhood.

Through careful consideration and exploration of these external factors, a person can cultivate an abundance of positive traits and become their best possible self.",AI

People often find that their first impressions or memories of a significant event can profoundly shape their outlook on life and how they conduct themselves in the future. For me, that event was my first day of school. As a five-year-old, I was incredibly nervous, but when I got to the school, I saw so many smiling faces and heard the warm greetings of the faculty, which put me immediately at ease and gave me the confidence to face the school year ahead. 

My first day of school left me with a lasting impression that has stayed with me over the years. Every day, I strive to bring the positive energy that I felt on that first day of school with me, reminding myself that people are generally good despite the occasional setbacks and negative experiences we all face. This outlook on life has been instrumental in helping me persevere through difficult times and make decisions that I’m proud of. 

Had that day not gone as well as it did, I’m certain that my outlook on the world would have been far different. It’s amazing how much of an impact one event can have. If the same situation presented itself again, I know that I’d be just as thankful for the chance to be surrounded by the positive energy of others.",AI

A few years ago I made a mistake and was charged with a minor crime. I quickly learned that even small offences can lead to big consequences and have lasting effects. I was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Although it was quite a long time to commit, I soon realized the value of giving back to the community; I met people that I would never have been connected to had I not made that mistake.

I realized how much I enjoyed the connection of helping others. Whenever I saw the impact that those hours had on the people we were helping, it re-affirmed that my time was making a difference. I grabbed every opportunity to volunteer to make sure I could make the most out of my mandated requirement. I was able to recognize the value of service and plans to stay involved with various volunteer organizations.

My experience of community service has been an eye-opening one. I have learned valuable lessons about why laws are in place and the importance of continuing to do the right thing.

When I look at failure, the first thing I think about is how much I have learned from personal experiences. One of the most influential experiences I have had with failure was when I missed a goal I had set for myself when I was younger. Although it was initially hard to grapple with, I eventually realized that the experience had helped me to grow as a person. By failing and coming to terms with the failure, I was able to develop a better understanding of how to work smarter and plan for things better in the future. 

Overall, failure is not something most people desire, yet it can be a productive process. It can instill a deeper level of motivation, leading to increased productivity and resilience. Failure can also be seen as a learning experience and spark self-reflection, as it gives people an opportunity to reassess their current strategies and formulate a better plan or approach. More importantly, failure can be one of the most powerful catalysts for success. It can be a pivot point where people decide to stand up, take action, and strive towards their goals with increased ambition and determination.

In conclusion, I believe that failure can have tremendous benefits for humans in the long run. While it may initially seem daunting, the lessons and knowledge provided from failure should be looked at as an opportunity to grow. Failure can help sharpen our skills, belief in ourselves, and provide an authentic platform to persevere towards success.",AI

In my opinion, students with a C average or lower should absolutely be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. It is important to remember that these students are likely doing their best to succeed in their classes and should not be excluded from other activities that will help them grow and develop in a positive way. For many students, taking part in extracurricular activities can help them to feel connected with their peers and provide an outlet from the stress of academics. It should also be noted that there will be times when students who are trying their best may still be having difficulty meeting the B average requirement; therefore, it is wrong to completely exclude them from experiencing activities outside of the classroom.

When it comes to choosing a career while still in high school, there are definite risks that come with the process. Most notably, young students can easily become overwhelmed, as they might not yet have the life experience or knowledge to make a wise and informed decision about their future. What's more, they might not know what they want to do in life, yet they are asked to decide; this can create a great deal of anxiety and stress. 

Societal pressure can also play a role in decisions made at this age, as students may feel pressured to begin their career earlier than necessary or to make choices that may not be in their best interest. This pressure extends far into our society, with both parents and peers pushing to make a “smart” decision about the future.

In summary, while there can be great rewards to beginning a career while in high school, it can also be detrimental and potentially overwhelming. It is important for young students to take into consideration their own emotions and feelings before deciding whether they want to take on a career while still in high school.",AI

The rapid growth of technology throughout the world has led to an unprecedented level of convenience for many people. Unfortunately, this growth has also had its drawbacks. One of the greatest losses of this age is the diminishing level of personal contact between individuals. Although technology may help reduce physical distance between family, friends, and colleagues by allowing us to chat or video call, there is still a disconnect between personal conversations and digital communication. This disconnect can have several negative effects on our relationships. For instance, it can limit our ability to have meaningful conversations, make us more prone to miscommunications, and make us more likely to become disconnected from people who don't use the same technology. 

Thankfully, there are proactive ways to combat the negative effects of technology's limitations on human contact. Making an effort to reach out to others in person can be a great way to strengthen relationships. By making the social effort to schedule an in-person meetup or outing, or even just a quick phone call, we can bridge the digital gap and nourish our relationships in a much more meaningful way than a text or email. Additionally, participating in outdoor activities is another great way to engage in face-to-face conversations and build stronger relationships. Taking a day or even just an hour away from technology can encourage more meaningful conversations, strengthen relationships, and create lasting memories with the people who mean the most to us. 

In conclusion, the rise of technology has undoubtedly had both negative and positive effects. By making an effort to limit our digital dependence, we can foster stronger connections with family, friends, and colleagues in a more meaningful way. Taking the time to engage in face-to-face conversations can strengthen our relationships and create memories that will last a lifetime.",AI

In both the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration was highly valued as a way of pooling resources and perspectives to achieve common goals. Collaboration typically involved two or more individuals or groups working together to obtain a desired outcome from a project. The collaborative approach allowed for different perspectives and ideas to be combined to create more effective solutions. 

For example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted. The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.

Combining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved. However, it is also important to understand the information and advice that is being provided before attempting to create a solution. In both Empires, it was viewed as essential to truly understand the opinion and contributions of all parties involved in order to create a favorable outcome.",AI

Partnership is an integral part of any learning experience. Working together to achieve a common goal allows individuals to discuss and debate ideas as well as collaboratively problem solve. It is through this exchange of ideas and input that learning can be deepened and strengthened. When working with a partner, it is also possible to get “second opinions” and different viewpoints on a particular topic or subject. When working in groups, each member can bring something unique to the situation and work together to form a bigger picture of the topic. This approach is especially effective in the classroom setting, where students can work together to gain a better understanding of the material. Working in groups also encourages everyone to engage more actively with their learning, opening up the possibility for further exploration and learning. Furthermore, having multiple people in a learning environment allows for a more efficient distribution of work, enabling learners to go further and more in-depth. By engaging in partnerships, learning is simultaneously enhanced and improved.",AI

Throughout history, many successful artists have gained perspective and wisdom from the criticism they have received. Notable figures such as Vincent Van Gogh and M.C. Escher learnt from constructive criticism on their works despite not seeing the success they eventually did until after their deaths. In the educational field, criticism is just as important as praise when helping students reach their potential.

Receiving criticism is an essential part of building resilience and establishing a growth mindset. In learning, students should be encouraged to challenge their understanding of topics and not be afraid of making mistakes. You cannot learn without taking the risk of making mistakes and potentially receiving criticism, but this should not be seen as a negative thing. By offering students constructive criticism, teachers can create an environment where it is encouraged to ask questions and take risks in learning.

Students should also understand that criticism can be more than just the negative aspect that it is often seen as. It can also be an invaluable source of feedback that can expose them to new ideas and concepts. Analyzing criticism can help students to learn and to understand concepts from a different perspective. With this understanding, students can acquire the skills of resilience and problem-solving.

Overall, the role of criticism as a tool of learning is essential, and its importance should be emphasized in the educational field. While positive reinforcement plays an important role, constructive criticism helps bring a complete educational picture, and in some cases, foster resilience and problem-solving skills in students.",AI

Respect is an important value that should be shared by all people regardless of age, country, or religion. Respect for others should be at the core of our interactions and is necessary for success in life. Not only will treating others with respect and kindness help to create harmony, but it can also lead to beneficial outcomes as well. 

When we are in a bad mood or feeling stressed, it can be easy to forget about other people's feelings and take out our frustrations on them. However, this could have a negative effect on our relationships, causing more tension and anger. It's important to remember that respect and kindness go a long way, even when you don't feel like it. 

When we show respect and consideration for those around us, it can lead to good outcomes. People will be more likely to help us out and return the favour when we treat them well. This could mean better relationships with friends and family, improved career opportunities, and increased respect from those around us. 

In summary, treating people with respect, regardless of age, country, or religion, is essential for life success. It is important to consider someone's feelings even when we are not in a good mood. The attitude we have towards others can have both beneficial and negative outcomes, so it is best to be respectful and kind.",AI

Studies are showing that a four-day work week with ten-hour days has a number of benefits for both students and teachers. For students, having the extra day of rest can provide them with more time to relax, mentally prepare for their future, and more time to study in order to pass classes. Teachers also need more time away from school in order to have time with their families, or to provide extra mentorship to their students outside of school. It has been shown that this type of schedule can also reduce stress for students and teachers, as well as providing time for both sides to engage in other activities. Moreover, students and teachers can benefit from the three-day weekend by being able to spend more quality time with family and friends, and by having more time for leisure and other activities to renew energy and stay productive.",AI

Reading books helps to develop our brains in several ways. Studies have found that different genres of books can help with different areas of cognitive development. For instance, fiction has been linked to improved empathy, while non-fiction can expand our knowledge base and critical thinking skills.

Working in a group can be more advantageous than working alone in many ways. By collaborating together, group members can share ideas, thoughts, and resources to create more comprehensive and creative solutions that may be less achievable individually. Working in a group can also include bouncing ideas off one another so members can identify any potential issues and provide helpful feedback and direction. Furthermore, group members are often more motivated and energized to work together, making the task more enjoyable than working alone. Lastly, shared accountability ensures that tasks are completed in a timely and effective manner, leading to better results than what could be achieved alone.",AI

The four-day school week has grown in popularity as an alternative to the typical five day school week. But what are the pros and cons of this new system? Research shows a potential for savings in energy and resources due to greater flexibility in managing the school calendar and the ability to reduce operational costs. But there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Students may find it difficult to adjust to an extended school day, teachers may feel overwhelmed by the longer teaching load, and the quality of education could be adversely impacted due to the lack of a traditional five-day week.

Further research into the effectiveness of the four-day school week is necessary in order to determine whether or not this system is a viable alternative to the traditional five-day school week. Several school systems have implemented this new system with both success and failure. For example, in the Wake County, North Carolina school system, students and staff reported greater job satisfaction and improved attendance. Conversely, in Arizona, the four-day school week had a significant negative impact on student performance and academic achievement.

When compared to the traditional five-day school week, the four-day week appears to have both environmental and economic benefits; however, caution must be taken to ensure that the quality of education is not sacrificed. It is important to consider the effect that the longer school day will have on students and teachers alike, and to ensure that the resources are available to maintain an adequate learning environment and to accommodate the longer school days. Ultimately, only when the potential benefits and drawbacks are considered in depth can a conclusion be drawn as to whether or not implementing a four-day school week for conserving energy and resources is a viable option.",AI

Praising students is an important part of building self-esteem. Self-esteem is a child's belief in their ability to succeed and meet goals. It helps to ensure that they face challenges with a positive attitude. Praise can create a positive environment and teach children that it is alright to take risks and challenge themselves, even if there may be some failures along the way.

When praising students, it is important to be specific. Rather than general statements like ‘good job’, focus on the process a child utilized to get good results. For example, praise them for their hard work and determination to practice and master a skill. Praising effort rather than results can make children feel confident in trying out new tasks without worrying about the outcome.

Another important thing to remember when praising students is to be genuine. Children can detect when someone is insincere, and when they do it can have the opposite effect on their self-esteem. Genuine praise will create more positive reactions in children and will motivate them to keep trying and doing their best.

Overall, praising students is an essential tool for helping to build self-esteem. It helps children to understand that trying and failing is a part of life, and that success may not come immediately but with effort and determination it can be achieved.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" is a powerful idea that can be applied in myriad contexts. It speaks to the idea that being true to one's self is a valuable and underrated task. Throughout life, there will be people and situations that try to change who you are, and there is great strength in resisting and staying true to oneself.

The first step to being oneself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is to recognize and accept one's own uniqueness. It is essential to understand that everyone is different - no one is exactly like anyone else, and no single individual possesses all the necessary skills and qualities in one package. Acknowledging and embracing this individuality can be both liberating and empowering. 

The next step is to devote time and energy to focusing on one's own needs and goals, rather than comparing oneself to others and attempting to constantly change oneself to keep up with their successes. Comparison is a pathway to unhappiness, because it distracts one's focus away from oneself. Instead, taking the time to set goals and develop long-term strategies to achieving them, regardless of external pressures and demands, is the most effective way to be oneself in a world that is trying to make you something else. Furthermore, by having an attainable plan to reach one's goals, one is less likely to be pulled away from achieving them.

In conclusion, it is clear that Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" is indeed true. Taking the time and effort to recognize and accept one's uniqueness, as well as focusing on one's own needs and goals, are two effective steps in achieving this greatest accomplishment.",AI

As a student, I believe that requiring students to maintain a grade C average to participate in extracurricular activities is a wise decision. In my opinion, students should understand that there is a direct correlation between their academic performance and their ability to participate in activities outside of the classroom. This gracefully encourages students to strive to do their best in school, and understand the importance of working hard to achieve their goals. 

Furthermore, this requirement allows the school to ensure that students can handle the extra workload associated with extracurricular activities, while still balancing their academic responsibilities. Ensuring this balance will lead to increased student success, as well as fewer overwhelmed and stressed students. It is crucial that students take the time to invest in their education and understand the importance of good grades, and this policy encourages them to make the effort. 

Overall, I believe this policy to require a grade C average is a beneficial change for the school activities. It raises the educational standards for our school, while motivating and inspiring students to make the most of their education.",AI

Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years with more and more schools offering online or virtual classes. As such, it can be a great option for students looking to get a quality education while balancing other commitments and interests. On the other hand, some may be apprehensive about this type of learning, as traditional schooling provides invaluable benefits such as personal interaction with teachers and classmates, individualized instruction, and consistent feedback. 

For those considering taking advantage of distance learning opportunities, I believe there are both pros and cons to consider. On the plus side, distance learning allows students to learn in their own environment where they can better control their schedule and other distractions. Additionally, many online courses are asynchronous, meaning students can access lectures and submit assignments on their own time. Not to mention, these courses can often be more affordable than traditional classes. 

On the other hand, there can be downsides to opting for distance learning. For one, there is no classroom setting, so teachers may be less available to answer questions face-to-face or have limited access to resources. Moreover, distance learning requires a great deal of self-discipline to stay on top of course material and complete assignments in a timely manner. Finally, this type of learning can be isolating and lack the social aspects that come with traditional in-person learning. 

Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to whether students should take advantage of distance learning opportunities. What works best for each individual student will depend on a variety of factors such as budget, goals, and preferences. Before deciding, one must consider the pros and cons to make a well-informed decision for their unique situation.",AI

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be incredibly beneficial when making important decisions in life. Having an outside source to help make choices can often lead to more successful outcomes, as they are often experienced professionals who can offer valuable, unbiased advice. For example, seeking guidance from a financial advisor when making major investment decisions can help to ensure the decisions are informed by the current market conditions, and will ultimately result in a much more profitable return on the investment. Similarly, when considering major career changes, a school or university career advisor can help identify the most beneficial courses to take and the most advantageous job prospects available to an individual. 

Further, a mentor or life coach can be incredibly helpful when it comes to personal growth. By cultivating an open relationship with someone who has more experience, people can gain the insight and advice they need when navigating personal challenges, and make more sound and holistic decisions as they evaluate professional and personal options.

The importance of focusing on a single task and avoiding idling can not be overstated. With so many distractions in our daily lives, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and start putting off the task at hand. By avoiding idling and staying focused on the task at hand, we are able to get more done in less time and achieve better results. This focus on singular tasks allows us to dig deeper and explore the details of the task more thoroughly, making sure to not miss any important components. 

However, there are still some limitations to focusing on a single task. By being so focused on one task, we can sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture and miss out on how the task fits into a larger set of goals and objectives. Additionally, if you are too focused on one task, you might become burnt out or lack enthusiasm for completing the same task on a regular basis. It can also be hard to maintain focus on a single task for a long period of time without becoming easily distracted due to fatigue or boredom. 

Overall, while focusing on a single task can be extremely beneficial and help you achieve better results, it is important to remember that there are also some limitations to be aware of.

Success is something many of us strive for, and many believe it is attainable through hard work and dedication. Achieving success often requires enthusiasm, education, and family support. Enthusiasm and motivation are critical for powering through hard work and obstacles, and education can provide the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed. Family support can provide needed encouragement and moral support to persevere when going through trying times.

However, jealousy and envy from others can hinder success if we let it. Unfortunately, when successful people are admired or their achievements praised, it can often breed envy or jealousy in others, which can be damaging to both the successful person and those who feel envious.

A plan for personal success should include setting and maintaining goals, developing a positive attitude, and consistently making efforts and putting in the necessary work to reach the desired objectives. Self-belief and perseverance are essential components of success, and it is important to be prepared for the possibility of failure. When faced with failure, it is critical to take the time to reflect on the experience before moving on and finding alternative paths.

In addition, it is important to stay open to creativity and new ideas along the way. Keeping secrets can be detrimental to success as well, since making connections with other people and building a strong network are crucial elements of achieving success. Having an open mind and being open to learning new things is essential, and maintaining focus on goals despite external pressures is a must. With the right attitude, enthusiasm, education, and family support, success can be within reach.",AI

As we live in a constantly evolving world, it is essential to stay on top of new trends and learn new skills. One of the best ways to learn is by exploring a new art form. Whether it be painting, dance, or music, art provides countless opportunities to express yourself and learn about the world around you. Learning a new art form can bolster creativity and enhance problem-solving skills. 

Another great way to enrich personal and professional development is by volunteering. Volunteering at a school or local community center allows us to help and support those in need. Through volunteering, we can give back to our communities and learn lifelong lessons about social responsibility.

The story of George Washington and Mrs. Locker's King demonstrates how important it is to stay humble and use your resources to help others. Despite adversity and discord, they worked diligently to help others and never lost sight of their goal. Through their hard work and dedication, they were able to make a positive impact.

One of the most enjoyable ways to spend time outside is to explore your surroundings. Depending on where you live, there are often many interesting and unique sights, sounds, and smells to take in. Talk a walk around your neighborhood and take a closer look at all of the details and beauty that nature has to offer. You can even take a bicycle ride or drive to new locations and have a picnic. 

Spending time with friends is also a great way to have an enjoyable time outdoors. You can catch up and talk, play fun games like soccer or basketball, and just enjoy each other's company. Doing activities like this together can provide a great source of positive energy and lasting memories.

In today's fast-paced world, it often feels impossible to stay true to oneself amidst the conflict between personal identity and social expectations. Pressure from the people around us can make it difficult to maintain our sense of self, especially if we feel like conforming to the expectations of the society is our only option. People are driven to become someone else in order to fit in with society, and often find themselves sacrificing their true identity in the process.

This need to conform can have dangerous repercussions. Hiding one's true identity may cause one to become increasingly out of touch with their emotions and the things that truly matter to them. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” Remaining true to oneself, despite the obstacles thrown in our path, shows tremendous courage and resilience.

Throughout history, there have been countless examples of people who have defied societal expectation to remain true to themselves. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Mahatma Gandhi are just a few famous figures who have courageously held onto their identities despite enormous pressure to conform to the status quo. 

It is not easy to stand up against the expectations of society, but by remaining true to oneself one can gain invaluable clarity, peace of mind, and strength.

Technology has become an integral part of modern life with its presence felt everywhere from the workplace to the home. While technology provides numerous positive effects for our lives, it also has numerous negative consequences. 

One of the major positive impacts of technology is the ability to enhance physical growth. Modern technology has improved the quality of life of people, especially those who lead an active lifestyle by increasing the range of activities available to them. A great example of this is the development of specialized physical training software and devices, such as fitness trackers and sports gear, that can be used to chart progress and set goals for athletes of all levels.

On the other hand, technology can also have a harmful effect on physical health. With so much time spent on devices and screens, people are becoming increasingly sedentary, leading to obesity and other physical health issues. Additionally, the development of gaming technology has been linked to a decrease in physical activity among children, which can have a negative effect on their overall growth and development. 

Technology also has a notable impact on learning, both in terms of the quantity and quality of the learning experience. On one hand, technology has made learning easier and more accessible by providing access to educational material and resources at any time and any place. On the other hand, technology has made it easier for people to become absorbed in entertainment and social media, resulting in a decrease of focus on more important topics or educational activities that require more in-depth engagement. 

Finally, technology has also had an impact on time management and lifestyle changes. Technology can help people become more productive with tools such as online calendars and task management apps. However, technology can also lead to distraction and over-dependence – people can become overwhelmed by the vast number of tasks and end up spending an excessive amount of time on their devices trying to stay on top of their workload. 

In order to reap the benefits of technology while mitigating the negative impacts, it is important to set boundaries and practice healthy device usage. Limiting the use of phones, tablets, and computers to certain times, or utilizing digital wellness solutions such as screen time trackers, can help people find the right balance between technology and their other interests and activities. Additionally, encouraging physical activity and setting aside time for self-care activities such as reading and playing sports can help people discover a healthier lifestyle.",AI

When it comes to deciding whether to take college classes or enter the military at an early age, it is important for students to consider all of their options and make an informed decision. While a quick decision may seem like the best option, rushing into a decision often leads to regrets in the long run. Elective courses offer students a way to express their interests and figure out what they truly desire. 

Through elective courses, students are able to explore different topics and open themselves to new possibilities. These courses offer a chance to learn about diverse areas, including the arts, American history, and science. By trying out different courses, students can deepen their understanding of their preferred subject and gain an insight into potential future paths. 

In addition, elective courses can provide a new perspective on the complex world around us. By taking elective courses outside of a student's comfort zone, they can gain vital skills such as creativity and problem-solving. As a result, students will be better prepared for whatever career they plan to pursue. 

To sum up, students should not rush into deciding which college classes to take or enter the military at an early age.

Peer pressure, advice from others, and social stereotypes can have a powerful effect on individuals. I experienced this firsthand when I was growing up. I was constantly told what I should and shouldn't be doing, who I should and shouldn't be friends with, and how I should and shouldn't dress. I struggled to be who I wanted to be versus who others expected me to be. 

This pressure to conform to the opinions and expectations of others is found in many cultures, each with their own unique social rules. For example, in China, there is a greater emphasis on traditional values and respect for elders. Disappointing a family member can be seen as a serious breach of protocol and can be met with disappointment and disapproval.

These experiences demonstrate how powerfully advice from others and peer pressure can influence our behaviour and decisions. Furthermore, when combined with social stereotypes, our behaviour and beliefs can become limited and even harmful. We must be aware of these influences and strive for self-acceptance and tolerance of others. 

Through recognizing the impact of advice from others, peer pressure and social stereotypes, we can gain a greater understanding of the effect they can have on individuals. With this insight, we can work to develop more confidence in ourselves and our beliefs, so that we can shape our own paths and break away from the constraints of social expectations. 

In conclusion, it is essential to be conscious of the power that these influences can have in shaping our beliefs and behaviour. We must be mindful of our own personal values and convictions, as well as those of others, to be better able to stay true to ourselves and break down the barriers of social norms.",AI

One of the main benefits of having a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) is that it can help create a feeling of well-being and encourage resilience in difficult situations. PMA allows people to view life's challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles, giving them the confidence to take the initiative and take risks. For example, someone with a PMA might look at a job loss as a chance to find a new job in an even better field. 

On the other hand, a PMA could be detrimental when taken to extremes. If someone takes a PMA too far they can become overly optimistic, leading them to gloss over potential risks and problems. For instance, someone with a PMA might take on a job with an unrealistic deadline, not fully understanding the difficulties associated with it. Ultimately, having a PMA can be beneficial in many situations, but it's important to recognize the risks involved.",AI

Despite the fear associated with failing, it is important to understand that failure can actually lead to success. As former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This statement emphasizes the importance of perseverance and enthusiasm despite all setbacks. 

Failure can be an essential learning tool in achieving success. Through failure, we can find out what works and develop a plan for effective action. Furthermore, failure often leads to a greater appreciation for success when it is achieved. Through gaining a better understanding of failure, it is possible to develop the skills necessary to reach success.

Consequences of failing must be taken into consideration however, as they can be detrimental to success. For instance, negative consequences of failure could include a lack of confidence, a fear of trying again, or discouragement from reaching goals. Therefore, it is important to remain positive and motivated despite any negative consequences of failure.

It is clear that failure and success exist in equal balance, and it is important to recognize that failure is not the end. As Winston Churchill stated, success and failure are two sides of the same coin, and these two elements are key parts of achieving success. By understanding failure and how it can lead to success, it is possible to remain enthusiastic and continue striving towards success.",AI

In recent years, much research has been done to determine whether true self-esteem comes from praise or achievement. Some studies have indicated that children who are regularly praised for improvement or progress experience higher self-esteem; however, this is not the same as true self-esteem. True self-esteem can only be derived from a sense of accomplishment or success. 

Giving praise for deficient work can have a negative effect on a student's learning. In these cases, the student is not being held to a high enough standard and has little incentive to strive for excellence. If praise is used in this manner, it may actually do more harm than good by instilling in the student a false sense of achievement and security.

While praise can be an important factor in a student's overall success, it cannot be the sole source of true self-esteem. Achievement is ultimately the more effective source of true self-esteem, as it is based on hard work and tangible results. Ultimately, both praise and achievement can be essential tools for helping students develop self-esteem, but ultimately achieving success is the best way for students to gain a true sense of self-worth.",AI

Example:

The actions of others have long been said to influence us as individuals. It is widely accepted that we are subject to the influence of a variety of people and institutions in our lives. From family to society, school to social media, we are constantly exposed to examples of how others behave, and these examples shape us in unpredictable ways.

Take our family, for instance; as children, we look to our parents to learn how to interact with the world — both what is appropriate and inappropriate. We observe their behaviors and mannerisms, often unconsciously mimicking the way they communicate and interact with others. Family dynamics are incredibly powerful, as the values and practices we observe at home become ingrained in our personal frameworks, influencing our decisions now and in the future.

On a larger scale, the influence of society and its institutions is something that affects us all. It is no mistake that the perception of education in our society is of the utmost importance; we associate success with education, something that is passed down to us in various ways from school. Whether it’s through the lessons we learn in the classroom, the expectations of grades, or the aspirations to achieve more, these values are taught to us from a young age, creating an expectation to try and do the best we can.

Furthermore, social media has become another incredibly powerful influence in recent times. It has provided us with a platform to interact with other people, providing a vast space for examples to be viewed and replicated. We are constantly exposed to what others are saying, doing, and believing, creating a proliferation of ideals and beliefs that have the power to shape us.

Though the influence of other people can be beneficial to a certain extent, it is important to note that example is not the only thing in influencing others — respect, dialogue, and mutual understanding are just as important. These key elements only come into play when we learn to recognize the importance of listening to one another, and understanding our shared humanity.",AI

Small acts of kindness can have an impact on others that goes far beyond just the doer and recipient. Kindness can be as simple as offering words of encouragement, volunteering time to help others, or even just sharing a smile with a stranger. These small acts of kindness can leave a lasting impression and brighten someone’s day. 

Research has shown that providing acts of kindness leads to higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in people. In 2009, Stephen Post, director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care and Bioethics at Stony Brook University, conducted a study involving 1,000 people. He found that ""acts of kindness, regardless of whether or not others notice them, significantly increase happiness"" in the people performing them. Other studies have shown that recipients of kind acts are eight times more likely to pass on that kindness to someone else than they are to pass on negative behavior, resulting in a ripple-effect of kindness that can be felt in our communities.

Having a positive mindset is key to understanding and promoting kindness, and this starts with the role that parents play. Parents must create an environment in which kindness is emphasized, and they must teach their children to be kind. This is something that requires effort and dedication; setting a good example and encouraging open discussions on how kindness can be demonstrated are great ways to foster this values in children. Additionally, research suggests that kindness is contagious and can create opportunities in people’s lives by opening doorways to positive physical and mental health benefits, improved relationships, and increased success. 

In conclusion, small acts of kindness have far-reaching impacts on both the doers and recipients, and should be encouraged. Having a positive mindset and being kind to others is an essential part of fostering a compassionate and understanding community. Kindness can create opportunities in people's lives, and parents are vital in setting an example for young generations to come. ",AI

Distance learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for students who are looking to attend classes from the comfort of home. There are a few key pros and cons that should be considered when deciding if distance learning is the right option for individual students. 

One of the main advantages of distance learning is the convenience that it offers. Students have greater flexibility in terms of when and where they can attend class, making it easier for them to maintain concentration. However, there is still an element of distraction from the home environment, particularly when it comes to online shopping. 

Another benefit of distance learning is that students have access to a wide range of learning materials, such as online books and videos, making it easier to acquire the resources necessary for their studies. Along with this, distance learning offers lower costs than traditional schooling, making it an attractive option for families with financial constraints. 

Yet, one of the main disadvantages of distance learning is the lack of social contact with peers and teachers. Additionally, online bullying is a real issue, and it can be harder to detect and prevent than in-person bullying. For these reasons, some students may benefit from the increased support and social interaction of traditional schools. 

In conclusion, distance learning is a great option for students who are looking to attend classes from home. That being said, it’s important to consider the various pros and cons before committing to a distance-learning course.",AI

Curfews often have a bad reputation; they are seen as too restrictive and something that will take away teenagers' freedom. But imposing a curfew on teenagers can have both positive and negative effects. 

One of the major benefits of having a curfew for teenagers is that it can help them establish a consistent sleep schedule. Teens need an average of 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep to help with physical and mental development, and having a timely curfew that is consistently enforced can help ensure that teens get the sleep they need. Research has also shown that getting enough sleep can help improve mood, reduce memory issues, and strengthen mental health.

Curfews can also help reduce instances of illegal activities. Since teens are more likely to commit crimes after dark, having a curfew that places limits on the amount of time teenagers can stay out can reduce the likelihood of these activities. 

On the other hand, there are also drawbacks of having a curfew for teenagers. Some have argued that curfews are too restrictive, and may result in teens feeling like they are not trusted or respected. It can also create a feeling of rebellion in teens and increase the chances of them breaking the curfew, leading to more legal issues. Additionally, some teens may be living in unfavorable home environments and could benefit from having more time away from home, which a curfew could take away. 

Overall, while a curfew for teenagers can help promote healthy sleep schedules and possibly reduce illegal activities, it can also have negative ramifications and may make teens feel restrained in their freedom. To truly evaluate the pros and cons of having a curfew for teenagers, one must consider careful evidence-based arguments for each side.",AI

Taking the first step in identifying a career path can be a daunting task, especially for young people. It is important that the direction reflects the unique interests and talents of the student. From there, it is necessary to explore education requirements for the chosen career path. For some students, choosing a career at young age can provide focus and a goal to work towards. But it can also limit students' flexibility in the long run, as changes in interest can be difficult to pursue. Additionally, it can be especially detrimental if students are forced into certain career paths without having the opportunity to explore their own interests. It's important to understand the potential negative effects of taking such a route. Researching career paths from a young age is essential, as it carries the potential to shape and direct students’ futures in a meaningful way.",AI

Staying out of trouble in school is essential to making sure you're able to stay in school and graduate on time. There are many ways to stay on the right side of the law and out of trouble while in school. Here are three of the most important: 

First, choose your friends wisely. It's no secret that the people around you have an influence on your behavior. Having friends who are successful academically and stay out of trouble can help you stay focused on doing the same. 

Second, set a good example for your peers. Showing leadership in the classroom or hallways can have a positive impact on other students and help them stay out of trouble. Be a role model and mentor to your peers and you'll set a good example of what it looks like to be successful in school.

Finally, establish positive relationships with school staff. The more positively your teachers and other educators view you, the less likely it is that you will get in trouble. Seek out the help of your teachers and school administrators when facing challenges and you'll be further away from potential legal issues.

Overall, staying out of trouble in school involves making good decisions, setting a positive example, and forming positive relationships. With the right approach, you can ensure that your school experience is trouble free.",AI

Staying busy is often regarded as a key ingredient in achieving success. But what does that really mean? Simply put, it means actively pursuing goals, and the advantages and disadvantages that come with it. 

The advantages of staying busy can be seen in the positive results that are often attained when individuals dedicate their resources and energy towards achieving a specific goal. Studies have shown that when individuals prioritize their tasks and goals, the end result is usually the successful completion of those goals. For many, setting and achieving goals is a form of self-improvement that provides a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. 

However, staying busy can also come with certain dangers. Busyness can often lead to fatigue, stress, and even physical exhaustion. Additionally, it’s possible that one’s workload and commitments can become overwhelming, leading to burnout and a feeling of apathy towards one’s projects.

When considering the benefits and drawbacks of staying busy, it’s important to recognize that it’s possible to find the right balance. For those seeking success, actively pursuing goals can be an important part of that journey, but it’s important to remember to take time to rest and recharge.  Learning when to take a step back and take a break is key to remaining healthy and productive.",AI

In his statement, Albert Schweitzer argues that ""example is the only thing in influencing others."" While this statement holds true in many cases, it is not a requirement for influencing people. In fact, individuals can be influenced by various other sources, such as television, the internet, or simply by other people's ideas. 

For example, when a person views an influential figure and is inspired by her ideals, she may start to emulate the characteristics that make that person successful. That doesn't necessarily mean she has had direct contact with the individual, and yet she is still being influenced. 

In addition, people can be influenced by the media without direct contact. From seeing inspiring and powerful messages in television commercials to reading motivating articles on the internet, people are often moved by the messages they ingest without ever knowing the source. 

Therefore, while direct example certainly has its place as a powerful tool for influence, it is not the only one and certainly not the only way to affect the behavior of others. With the myriad of possible influences available to people, direct example is just one small piece of the puzzle.",AI

Technology has made a vast impact on people's lives in the past several decades. Despite popular opinion, this impact is overwhelmingly positive, leading to improved quality of life and unprecedented opportunities for societal advancement. 

Experts have found that technology can help people improve their productivity, as well as their motivation. For example, studies conducted by Stanford researcher Clifford Nass have shown that technology can improve people’s ability to focus on tasks, allowing them to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, texting has been found to improve people’s mental well-being by facilitating daily communication with friends and family.

Further evidence suggests technology can help people establish greater autonomy and express themselves creatively. For instance, smartphone applications provide tools for people to document and express their daily lives, from simple journals to video production. Additionally, studies have found that technology can help people break down barriers and connect more easily with individuals from diverse backgrounds, allowing for greater global awareness and understanding.

Overall, technology has been a hugely positive influence on people’s quality of life. By allowing us to prioritize our focus, stay connected with loved ones, and explore creative avenues, technology is a powerful force that should be embraced, rather than feared.",AI

Graduating early from high school and working for a year before college can have lasting benefits for students. For one, they can take that time to save up money for college costs. Although tuition and fees for college are rising year after year, students who work before college and carefully manage their finances can put themselves in a better position to afford college tuition. Furthermore, the experiences gained from working will help mature students and provide them with skills such as time management that will be invaluable in college. 

On the other hand, some may argue that taking a year off to work can be a deterrent to college motivation and preparation. Students who do choose to graduate early and take a year off before college may not feel adequately prepared for the academic rigor that college demands. And given the competition to get into college, a gap year may cause some potential universities to look unfavorably on a student's application. 

Nevertheless, graduating early and working for a year before college has proven to be a beneficial experience for many students. The financial and personal growth opportunities that it provides may ultimately be invaluable to success in college and beyond.",AI

Individual character is shaped by a variety of forces beyond one's control, and this idea is reflected in the quote by John Lubbock, ""It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich."" This notion applies to both material and immaterial wealth; while some may be born with an abundance of natural resources, it is only those who know how to properly use and appreciate all that they possess that can truly benefit from their possessions. Character is formed by the physical contexts in which a person is raised, as well as the values, morals, and beliefs that are instilled in them from society. The quote emphasizes that this underlying wealth or capital must be recognized and put to use in order to see the greatest value. In other words, we must be purposeful in our approach to whatever resources we may have. Through understanding and realizing the potential of our possessions, we can be more successful in life.",AI

Online schooling has become an increasingly popular option in recent times, and it is important to assess its pros and cons in relation to traditional in-person schooling. On the positive side, the advantages of online schooling include flexibility and convenience that allows students to work at their own pace, as well as access to resources online. However, there are some notable drawbacks too, such as lacking face-to-face interaction with peers or teachers, which is essential for collaborating and gaining insight from instructors.

There are many ways students can receive help while taking online classes. Many teachers offer additional tutorials or written feedback to help students understand the material better. Schools typically have online resources such as discussion forums or virtual conferences that allow students to ask questions and stay in touch with their teachers and classmates. However, there are some potential problems that students may experience with online classes. For example, students may struggle to understand the material and feel lack of motivation and commitment towards it, and may forget assignments due to lack of reminders.

When it comes to whether or not online schooling should be offered, there are both arguments in favor and against. Proponents of online schooling argue that it offers students flexibility and access to resources that in-person classes cannot. Critics, on the other hand, contend that online schooling cannot replace in-person classes, as it leaves out crucial aspects of student development such as collaboration and interpersonal communication. Ultimately, in order to decide whether online schooling is beneficial or detrimental, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each form of learning.",AI

It is becoming increasingly popular for high school students to complete high school in three years, instead of the traditional four-year model. There are many advantages to this accelerated approach, such as being able to take classes before and after school in order to cover the content more quickly, and the ability to forego taking elective courses in order to focus on core courses. Finishing high school in three years can also better prepare students for college, as they may be able to take college classes as early as the end of their junior year. 

However, there are some drawbacks to finishing high school in three years. Students may find themselves feeling increased fatigue from coming early and staying late in order to be able to complete the required courses. Additionally, students may be missing out on important developmental experiences which can come from taking elective classes and socializing with peers during lunch and other in-school activities. Before deciding to take on the challenge of finishing high school in three years, students should consider the pros and cons carefully.",AI

In a world filled with various opinions, values, and beliefs, it is all too easy to feel lost and confused. It can be hard to remain true to yourself amidst the arguments, pressures, and judgements of others. However, it is absolutely vital to stay true to who you are despite the external pressure that society places on you. 

Unfortunately, many people look to others around them and feel as if they need to conform in order to fit in. They might take on certain attitudes or interests that do not reflect their true values. This can lead to a kind of disconnect between the person's inner self and their external self which can cause many difficulties in life.

The best way to counteract this is to make sure that you take the time to know yourself, understand your values, and trust in your opinions. It is important to remember that no one else can decide how you should live your life. You must make the effort to stand up for your convictions, regardless of the demands of those around you. Furthermore, it is important to assert your emotions and acknowledge what you are feeling. Ignoring or repressing your emotions can only lead to distress in the long run. 

It is easy to allow external forces to shape your identity, but asserting and embracing your own identity is the most rewarding path in life. Once you accept yourself and the unique perspectives and values that make you who you are, you are better able to take part in meaningful conversations and experiences with others, as well as navigate through life’s demands.",AI

Childhood, environment, and culture are all integral factors and building blocks for forming a person's character. Childhood lays the foundation for essential skills, relationships, and beliefs that shape the person’s sense of identity for years to come. A person's environment is the place in which they interact with people and the world, in a positive or negative manner. The culture shapes a person's beliefs, attitudes, and values while surrendering to certain ways of life in the community.

Growing up, a child is exposed to a diverse range of people, situations, and beliefs. Those experiences, as will their environment, shape the way the person behaves and reacts to life. A negative environment, for example, may cause the child to grow to be anxious and insecure. In contrast, a positive environment may encourage a child to be more social, compassionate, and imaginative. The culture of the community is the basis of shared norms and values, such as respect for elders and cooperation among peers. These can form the core values of the mindset, providing the basis for a person's ethical views and interpersonal attitudes.

The overall effect of these key factors in a person's development helps define their character and determine how they react and interact in society. Through the lens of childhood, environment, and culture, a person can come to understand how multiple facets of a person's formative life events have molded their character today.",AI

In the modern world, technology plays an increasingly large role in our daily lives. While the limitation of physical contact between people may be considered a drawback of technology, it is not the only possible outcome. There are undeniable benefits to technological advancement, particularly in terms of reducing the amount of time needed to complete daily tasks and increasing our autonomy and convenience. 

One distinct advantage to technology is that it reduces the amount of time needed to complete mundane tasks. For example, the introduction of automated machines has drastically reduced the amount of time needed to manufacture products. Similarly, online banking services help people manage their finances faster through the convenience of automation. 

Not only does technology reduce the time spent on tasks, it also provides greater autonomy and convenience to people's lives. With the help of smartphones and other devices, people can access a plethora of information, meaning they have access to a host of tools and knowledge at the touch of a button. This makes tasks that would have otherwise been difficult or impossible not long ago significantly easier.

Extending school one and a half hours each day has potential benefits of providing students with more opportunities for success. It could enable longer class sessions, allowing for more in-depth subject material to be taught, as well as more time for extra-curricular activities or for additional help from teachers and staff. Furthermore, this could result in improved student engagement, better academic performance and higher graduation rates. 

At the same time, extending school each day could lead to fatigue and stress for both students and staff. There is also a potential for significant increases in operational costs for teachers, administrators, and support staff. 

Despite potential drawbacks, longer school days could lead to more productive and meaningful learning, as more time could be devoted to reading, laboratory experiments, field trips, or project based learning. It could also provide more opportunities for physical activity, as students would have more time for sports and extracurricular activities, and potentially introduce students to more diverse activities. 

Extending school one and a half hours each day could also help motivate students by providing a sense of purpose and helping them stay focused by providing predictable and organized routines. This could also give students the opportunity to develop better time management skills, as they would have additional time to plan and prepare for their studies and activities. 

The research findings indicate that extending school one and a half hours each day has the potential to have positive impacts on student learning and to motivate students to strive for greater success. Yet, there are also potential drawbacks that need to be taken into account. All factors should be assessed and weighed carefully before implementing longer school days.",AI

Reaching goals helps to build an individual's self-esteem in many ways. Accomplishing a goal gives an individual a renewed sense of self-confidence and a feeling of self-efficacy they can use to tackle the next goal. This increase in self-confidence pushes them to persist in their efforts to reach the goals they have set for themselves. Furthermore, reaching a goal gives an individual a sense of accomplishment and self-praise that can last long after the goal has been achieved.

Recent studies have shown that when people make progress towards a goal, their self-esteem increases. For instance, athletes demonstrate improved self-concept after successfully completing a challenging physical task, such as running a race or performing a difficult routine in a gymnastics event. Additionally, students who make progress in their academic endeavors often report higher levels of self-esteem. When students improve their grades, their self-concept tends to improve as well.

Overall, the evidence confirms that achieving goals helps enhance an individual's self-esteem in multiple ways. Accomplishment of a goal not only provides an individual with long-lasting satisfaction but also pushes them to continue striving for greatness. With little effort, these positive behaviors can help individuals feel more empowered and confident in their endeavors.",AI

As students begin to develop a sense of individual identity, the career paths they pursue change drastically. Elementary school students are typically unaware of the concept of a long-term job and tend to approach career choices from a more whimsical perspective. On the other hand, middle school students start to recognize the consequences of their decisions and may begin to commit to a career path. This age group may also begin to explore the creation of a resume and the development of professional skills. 

Unfortunately, many adults may view teenagers as too inexperienced or immature to decide on a career. However, this belief fails to acknowledge the reality of the modern world in which teenagers can commit to long-term goals earlier on. Young people can demonstrate the breadth of their experience and knowledge which shows that not all adolescents are the same.

Even with the ambition and drive to pursue a career, teenagers still face unique challenges. They may not have the educational background or internships necessary to enter professional fields.

As I reflect on my friendships, I'm grateful to have so many people in my life that have shared their Wisdom and Experience with me. It is truly a luxury that many people do not have. Wisdom and Experience can be invaluable resources for making the right choices, particularly when it comes to making difficult decisions. Access to this information helps us better understand activities quickly, as well as consider multiple points of view that we may otherwise ignore. From the insight gleaned from others, we can gain an increased appreciation of certain activities by understanding the reasoning behind them and how we can best apply them.

Wisdom and Experience can also help us become stronger. Knowing the challenges that others have faced, and how they overcame them, provides us with strength and motivation to pursue our goals. We are better able to trust our instinct and bypass any doubt that would otherwise prevent us from reaching our highest potential. Furthermore, by understanding the choices that led to past successes, we can increase our level of confidence in the decisions that we make.

In conclusion, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of Wisdom and Experience in helping us make the right choices, understand activities more quickly, and become stronger.

This can be detrimental to our own personal growth, both professionally and personally. Dissatisfaction is natural and healthy, as it often encourages us to strive for more and become better versions of ourselves, however it can also be dangerous if taken too far. It is wise to endeavor to constantly learn new things and strive further than our current capabilities -- continually striving for more can help us become more confident, rounded individuals.

Distance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate. 

It is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting. On the other hand, there is also the potential for this type of learning to lead to poorer academic performance due to the lack of social interaction and peer motivation.

In conclusion, although there are both positives and negatives when it comes to providing distance learning options, the pros do appear to outweigh the cons. As such, it is essential that schools embrace this technology and provide the necessary resources to help students take advantage of these opportunities and maximize their potential.",AI

Extending the school day by two hours could potentially provide students with a number of benefits. With additional time, students could benefit from smaller class sizes, less competition for resources and access to more subjects. Furthermore, by allowing students to have more time for projects and assignments, they may improve their academic knowledge and skills. Studies show that longer school days can provide students with more time for socializing, which can have positive effects on physical and mental health. 

However, extending the school day by two hours could have potential negatives as well. This could lead to an increase in stress levels since students will have less time for rest and leisure activities. Furthermore, without adequate compensation, teachers may struggle to accommodate the extra burden, leading to poorer overall educational standards. Additionally, there could be drawbacks to the community. A longer school day may mean that fewer people are available to work, as well as decrease job availability for those providing after school activities for children. 

In conclusion, while there are potential benefits for students in extending the school day by two hours, there are also possible drawbacks for teachers, students, and the community. Ultimately, a decision should be made carefully, and include taking into consideration things like potential physical and mental health effects, educational benefits and potential community impacts.",AI

First impressions are not only invaluable in our everyday lives but they often have long-lasting repercussions. From a job interview to a romantic first date, the first impressions we give can make the difference between success and failure.

I remember when I applied for my first job after university, I was extremely nervous going in for my interview. The interviewer's initial impression of me may have been the deciding factor in landing the job. Although I was anxious, I was able to put together a successful interview and went on to receive the position. In this case, my good first impression secured me a job I was highly qualified for but could not have gotten without making a strong initial connection.

This concept applies to many other areas of life, from relationships to work performance. I have observed in my peers and coworkers that those who present themselves well to their superiors often receive more favorable treatment in the workplace. The ones that put more effort into making positive connections with their peers or colleagues prove to be more successful as well.

It is essential to remember that first impressions are only part of the equation and do not determine the outcome of the situation.

Many of us struggle with choosing the right character, or path, to follow in life. It can be a daunting process to select which direction to take; however, doing so can ultimately lead to more success and satisfaction in the end. 

It's similar to choosing a partner or learning from a teacher; both require careful consideration of individual values and principles that determine who you will be spending your time with, or learning from. Taking a step back to analyze what you need in order to grow is essential. For example, if you're looking for a romantic partner, you must think of the qualities you're looking for and how those are compatible with the type of person you are. When it comes to learning from a teacher, the process might be similar, but the questions become: what can I learn from this person, and what skills will I leave with?

Once a character has been chosen, it's important to stay true to one's own sense of self. This means being able to face any unforeseen challenges without straying from the path towards your final goals in life. Through determination and perseverance, one can find their way to a successful and fulfilling life.",AI

Learning art is a valuable and enriching experience that can be enjoyed by all ages. Throughout history, different types of art classes have emerged, including painting, woodworking, music, drama, and even dance. Famous expressionists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo have helped to promote the importance of art for generations. Musical instruments such as the harp and the flute can often be found in art classes, as well as popular plays like ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""The Comedy of Errors"". 

Taking an elective course provides a much more beneficial experience when compared to a required class. Electives allow students to choose classes that offer more interests and learning opportunities that are not necessarily offered in the required classes. This allows them to explore different activities that they may not normally seek out, encouraging them to develop new skills and gain knowledge outside of their traditionally structured courses. 

Additionally, allowing students to choose their own electives gives them a level of autonomy, helping to foster independence and creativity. It provides an opportunity for students to find classes that are engaging and stimulating for them, which can lead to more involved learning. This is far more beneficial to having a required class, where the content may not be viewed as exciting or engaging by the student, resulting in a lack of interest and in worse case scenarios, failure.

Extending the school day appears to be an increasingly popular solution as parents, teachers, and administrators work to improve academic success. There are numerous arguments both for and against longer school days, and it is important to examine all of them in order to make an informed decision. 

One of the main arguments in favor of extending the school day is that it can give students more time to focus on their academic studies and gain a deeper understanding of the material. This could lead to better test scores and an improvement in educational outcomes. Additionally, a longer school day could also provide more time for clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities, allowing for more opportunities for students to explore their interests and connect with their peers. 

However, there are also several potential downsides to a longer school day. A longer school day may lead to students feeling increasingly stressed out and exhausted. Furthermore, when school begins too early and ends too late, students may be robbed of important sleep, which could lead to physical and mental health issues. 

In conclusion, while extending the school day can certainly have some benefits for students, such as giving them more time for academic and social activities, it is essential to weigh the potential costs as well. It is ultimately up to the school and parents to decide what is right for their particular communities, taking into consideration the students’ needs for adequate sleep and for other parts of their lives outside of school.",AI

It is widely believed that success in this world requires more than hard work and dedication; it requires taking brave and risky decisions. A great example of this idea is the story of Brad, an ambitious young professional who was looking to make a career change. Although his family had been advising him to stay in his current field, his heart was telling him to take a chance. Despite the risks, Brad followed his intuition and made the move; he soon found himself quickly climbing the career ladder and achieving more than he had ever dreamed of.

The importance of tuning out the “voice of reason” and instead following our hearts cannot be understated. Too often we measure success within a narrow scope of what is expected of us, and we forget that what can truly make us successful is found in our personal journey. It is not uncommon to make mistakes and even encounter failure along the way, but if we use these moments to grow and gain a better understanding of ourselves, we will eventually find true success.

Overall, there is great reward in taking chances and in learning from the unexpected paths we find ourselves on. It can help us break free of assumptions of what success looks like, and allow us to establish our own definitions of success and happiness. Ultimately, the advice to follow our hearts is not just an old wives’ tale – it is essential for achieving success in life.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an advocate for self-reliance and his views have been passed down for generations. He maintained that one should never try and become someone else, no matter what the pressure may be, in order to fit in but instead be true to oneself. He argued that if each individual strived to be their own, unique and individual person, that person would be able to make more of an impact on the world than if they were just a clone of someone else in order to get ahead in life. This has become especially relevant in today’s society as the lure of material goods is often seen as more important than core values and beliefs. This theme of ""being yourself"" is sometimes met with criticism or even ridicule from people with different points of view, yet Emerson argued that this attitude is essential in order to bring about positive change. He even argued that trying to emulate someone else in order to get a job could be unsuccessful because of an inability to create any original ideas or thoughts. For Emerson, it was clear that being yourself and finding one's inner autonomy was essential to growth and development.",AI

First impressions are incredibly powerful and should not be taken lightly. From a single look, we can assess a person’s personality, intelligence, and even their trustworthiness. But what happens if that judgment proves to be inaccurate - if the person we initially took an immediate dislike to turns out to be a valuable friend or mentor? What if we find out further down the line that their first impression has nothing to do with their character at all? I believe that first impressions can be changed with the right combination of charisma and personality.

Having charisma and personality are essential for creating a good first impression, as they can help people overcome any negative preconceptions they might have. Charisma is often seen as an innate quality, but it can also be developed over time, as people learn how to use gestures, expressions, and body language to influence the people around them. Personality, on the other hand, is about presenting the best version of yourself in any given situation, and is something that can be worked on with practice. 

To illustrate my point, consider the following scenario: I recently met someone who I felt an immediate dislike for. But after getting to know them better and seeing them in different environments, I realized that my first impression was wrong. This experience taught me that there’s more to a person than their first impression. It also taught me that it’s important to be open-minded and willing to give people a chance regardless of first impressions.

In conclusion, first impressions can be changed. By combining charisma and personality in a positive way, people can work to create a better first impression and challenge negative preconceptions. Ultimately, it’s important to give people the benefit of the doubt and be willing to give them a chance.",AI

Sir Winston Churchill, a celebrated statesman, once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This inspiring sentiment speaks to the power of perseverance, a sentiment the many successful people of today undoubtedly embody. 

Take for example, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Bezos famously took a huge risk in 1996 when he resigned from his highly successful job in finance, with no clear plan for what followed. Nonetheless, he made the leap of faith and invested everything he had into launching Amazon. And the rest is history: Amazon quickly rose to become one of the largest companies in the world.

Similarly, stories of personal failure and eventual success are ubiquitous. Whether it be a friend who failed out of school yet eventually graduated with honors, or a family member who failed to launch a business only to eventually achieve success with their second venture. The common denominator is often resilience.

If one aspires to success, then it is important to consider one's own relationship to failure. This essay seeks to explore why failure is necessary for eventual success.

Outline: 
I. Introduction
II. Historical Examples: Winston Churchill, Jeff Bezos 
III. Personal Stories of Failure and Success
IV. Resilience Overcomes Failure
V. Conclusion 

Draft: 

Success is the goal of many, and yet is often a long and arduous journey. Sir Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This quotation speaks to the power of courage and perseverance, values that are echoed in both famous and personal stories of success. Historical examples such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos demonstrate how failure is often a catalyst for eventual success. Equally, within our own personal lives, we have stories of failure and eventual success. These stories often involve resilience over time. Therefore, this essay will explore why failure is necessary for eventual success. 

Historically, successful leaders such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos serve as reminders that while failure can be disheartening, it is not the end of the road. Churchill was born into a politically influential family with a seemingly predestined career in politics, making his eventual failure less surprising. Churchill served in the military, where he was a failure, and suffered defeats in politics. But, despite the discouragement, Churchill applied his courage and press",AI

Making my own decisions has proven to be an incredibly beneficial choice in my life. Taking control of my decisions has allowed me to learn and grow far more than any external expert or authority ever could. 

For example, when I was deciding what college to attend, I chose to ignore the advice of my high school guidance counselor and followed my own instincts. I did my own research and compared the various programs available to me, ultimately choosing a college that was different from the one recommended to me. This gave me the opportunity to explore and learn independently, expanding my knowledge well beyond the preconceived ideas of a single person.

Another example of why it’s best to make my own decisions can be found in my career. Rather than trying to follow a predetermined path proposed by someone else, I chose to make my own decisions about what job I wanted. This enabled me to explore opportunities that I otherwise wouldn’t have been aware of and ultimately led me to a field that I am passionate about and enjoy working in.

Finally, when it comes to important life decisions, I prefer to make my own decisions rather than following the advice of authority figures. For instance, when it comes to matters of health and wellbeing, I like to do my own research and make decisions that are based on my own understanding of my body and needs. This allows me to make choices that are best suited for my individual circumstances and beliefs.

In conclusion, it is far better to make your own decisions in life rather than seeking guidance from experts or authorities. Making my own decisions has allowed me to learn, grow, and make choices that reflect my personal beliefs and individual needs.",AI

One of my most remarkable talents I have developed over the years is my ability to write. Since I was a child, I have expressed my creativity through the written word. I have always been an avid reader and my love for literature inspired me to explore the power of written expression.

I have developed my writing skills mainly through practice and dedication. I have had many amazing teachers who aided me in my journey. From reading classical works to understanding the importance of grammar, I have benefited greatly from their guidance. This has shaped my writing style and equipped me with the necessary tools to express my ideas accurately.

Aside from my teachers, some of my closest friends also have influenced the way I write. I value their feedback and opinion when it comes to my work and they have pushed me to improve by inspiring me to write in a way that encourages people to think critically.

Overall, I am proud that I have used my passion to cultivate a unique skill over the years. With the help of my teachers and friends, I have built upon the foundations of my writing abilities and refined my craft. Now I can create pieces that allow a wide range of people to look at a situation from a different perspective.",AI

Having the right guidance to make the right decisions in life is essential. From our parents helping us to make the right choice in school to highly-qualified professionals aiding us in our careers, it is important to look out for experts and authorities who can help us make the most of our lives. 

Taking guidance from experts and authorities can have many potential benefits. Firstly, the knowledge they possess can give us the insight and understanding we need to make informed decisions for our future. Furthermore, those decisions can be tailored to fit our individual tastes, situation, and aspirations. Being advised by an expert means that our decisions can be based on far more than mere guesswork.

An example of this can be seen in my own educational career. When deciding which university to attend, not only did my parents provide me with direction and advice, but our local family doctor, who had firsthand knowledge of the academic programs offered in our area, gave me invaluable guidance. I ultimately chose a major, and institution, that was in line with my interests and goals. Looking back, it is clear that having access to credible advice and guidance of this kind was instrumental in me being where I am today.

In conclusion, taking guidance from experts and authorities in life's important matters has vast potential benefits. From allowing us to make informed choices to giving us an extra level of support, the advantages of doing so cannot be understated.",AI

Distance learning has some notable drawbacks compared to traditional classroom-based instruction. For example, distance learning may not allow for face-to-face interaction, making it difficult for teachers to provide feedback and support. Distance learning can also be less engaging for students, as it can lack the competition and collaboration seen in traditional classrooms.

Studies have found that interpersonal interactions between teachers and students are important for learning. Communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can all have a positive impact on student performance and engagement. Teachers can provide students one-on-one feedback to address areas of difficulty or confusion, as well as praise for a job well done. The presence of peers in the classroom creates an atmosphere of competition that encourages students to work harder. Finally, teachers can serve as a model of success and inspire students to reach their goals.

While online courses do offer a more flexible learning option, they cannot replicate the communication, competition, and inspiration of a traditional classroom. Interaction with peers is limited and feedback from teachers can be delayed or difficult to understand. Furthermore, there may be less motivation to succeed as there is no sense of competition.

Attending classes in person is an invaluable educational experience that offers communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers that distance learning cannot. Traditional classrooms provide students with the guidance and support they need to be successful, as well as an engaging learning environment that promotes engagement and independent learning.",AI

After careful consideration of the topic, it is clear that there are valid benefits to both working alone and working with a group. Working alone has the advantage of allowing an individual to work at their own pace and without having to answer to or coordinate with other people. Additionally, research has shown that people who are typically given more autonomy and decision-making power over their own work tend to perform better and have more productive results. Similarly, working with a group also has its advantages, as it offers the opportunity to work collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. Working with a group also allows an opportunity to brainstorm, divide tasks, and have built-in accountability partners. Furthermore, research conducted by Harvard Business Review found that companies that promote collaboration within their teams achieved higher success and out-performed other organizations who relied primarily on individual work. 

In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group offer unique advantages. Depending on the individual or the nature of the task, one method may be more advantageous than the other. However, the most successful teams often combine both methods to capitalize on the strengths of both.",AI

Research has shown that having shorter school time for students can offer a number of physical, emotional, and developmental benefits. Among these are increased cognitive function, improved physical health, and a greater sense of happiness and well-being. However, some opponents claim that having shorter school time will be detrimental to students in the long run, resulting in less time spent engaged in meaningful educational activities. While this is a point worth considering, it is important to remember that students who receive shorter school time are less likely to suffer from the effects of burnout and fatigue, allowing them to focus more effectively and enjoy a healthier work-life balance. 

In recent years, celebrities such as Eminem have gained recognition for their similar educational paths. While Eminem's lack of formal education may have had its advantages, such as the freedom to focus on his music career, it also has its drawbacks. The lack of traditional education may have hindered depth of knowledge in certain areas and made the development of a well-rounded professional skillset more difficult. 

Having shorter school time is important to ensure students are given the time and space to flourish both academically and socially, particularly in an era when academic pressure is at an all-time high. As students are inundated with extracurricular activities and overwhelming expectations, it is essential that their academic learning should not be hindered by undue pressures. Having shorter school time to ensure adequate rest and recovery is the best way to guarantee students’ success. Overall, shorter school time is necessary to ensure that each student's educational journey is just and equitable.",AI

When it comes to problem-solving, there is no substitute for doing your best. When faced with a difficult situation, our initial reaction is often to give up and accept a subpar solution. But by refusing to accept anything less than our best effort, we open ourselves up to possibilities we hadn’t considered. 

Take, for instance, the famous story of Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb. Despite failing thousands of times to make a functioning bulb, Edison kept pushing himself to create something that worked. His relentless dedication paid off in the form of one of most important technological inventions in history. It’s a remarkable example of the power of persistence and of doing your best to solve a problem no matter how challenging.

I experienced this firsthand when I was applying to college. During the application process, I kept running into roadblocks. It felt like I was up against an insurmountable task. But instead of giving up, I persevered until I found a solution. My willingness to put in the effort led to my acceptance into the college of my dreams.

Ultimately, doing your best to solve a problem is the only way to produce beneficial results. With determination and a lot of hard work, nearly any challenge can be overcome. So the next time you find yourself facing an obstacle, remember to stay committed and never stop striving for the best.",AI

In summary, due to a growing awareness of students’ academic performance and the increasing necessity for them to reach a certain level of academic achievement, many schools have implemented policies that require students to obtain a certain grade average to be eligible to participate in sports.

The primary benefit of these policies is that it encourages students to strive for higher academic achievement while in school, as grades are an important factor both in eligibility to participate in sports and further educational opportunities like college and technical training. Furthermore, these policies also encourage students to prioritize their school work over sports, reducing the potential for academic neglect.

At the same time, however, there are significant drawbacks to these policies. Lower-income students, students with English as a second language, or students with learning disabilities or other special needs may struggle to meet these standards, putting them at a significant disadvantage as far as participation in school sports is concerned. In addition, some have criticized the policies for stigmatizing students who don’t reach the grade average, creating a potentially negative atmosphere in the school.",AI

Technology has become an increasingly integral part of modern life. It brings both positive and negative aspects that affect our lives in many ways. On the one hand, technology has revolutionized communication, making it easier to stay connected with friends and family and access information quickly. Technology has also brought about many advancements in medical care, making healthcare more accessible and improving quality of life. On the other hand, technology can be limiting; with so much information available, it can be difficult to know what is accurate and reliable. It can also lead to feelings of isolation, as we increasingly rely on technology to interact with one another. Additionally, technology can cause us to neglect face-to-face communication, exercise, and other social and personal activities.

Overall, technology offers both benefits and drawbacks that should be taken into account when considering its influence in our lives. Technology can help us stay connected and informed, but it can also cause us to forget about the importance of truly engaging with our environment. We must use technology mindfully, taking its advantages while limiting its harmful effects.",AI

The idea of adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day has a few obvious drawbacks. For students, it means that they would have to arrive to school earlier and stay later, effectively reducing the amount of time spent outside of school. This could have a negative impact on after-school activities such as sports, music, clubs, and jobs, which could further limit opportunities for hands-on learning and socialization. On the other hand, it could also put a strain on students who already lead extremely busy lives and may not have the energy to stay in school longer each day. 

From the perspective of teachers, the increased hours could create additional challenges when it comes to maintaining lesson plans, grading assignments, and providing individual attention. In addition, it could also create a scheduling conflict for teachers who work outside of the school environment.

For parents, an extra 30 minutes in the school day could significantly increase the cost of their child's education and may even disrupt the family's daily schedule. It could also mean that they have less time with their children in the evenings, further limiting the amount of parental involvement in their child's education.

Ultimately, adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day could have a wide range of effects for students, teachers, and parents. It is important to consider each individual perspective before making a decision on this issue, especially since it could have lasting implications for everyday life and scheduling.",AI

Being oneself is an extremely important part of life, as it is the only way to truly express who you are and make a positive impact on those around you. When individuals embrace their own values, passions, dreams, and goals, they create an example for others to follow and an inspiration for change. Being yourself can show others that it is ok to be unique and different from the status quo, and to be proud of their individuality.

One positive effect of being yourself is that it can create connections with people. For example, if you share your own passions and dreams with others, others may be inspired by your drive and commitment. This connection can lead to collaboration on projects and help create opportunities in the community. By forging these connections, individuals can create a strong support system where everyone can be open and honest with each other. 

Another positive effect of being yourself is that it can help create positive change in the world. By being yourself and embodying certain values, you can show others that it is possible to make a difference. This can raise awareness of social issues and problems, and can mobilize positive action for change. It can also inspire others to become advocates for those around them. 

In conclusion, being yourself is an essential piece of life and can lead to positive change in the world.

Recent studies have shown that having a longer winter break than summer poses a threat to students’ ability to retain information. This is because of the physiological impact that extended vacations have on the brain. During a prolonged break, the brain is likely to forget more information, leading to fewer opportunities for recall. Furthermore, experiences during a long vacation can affect a student's ability to pay attention in class, leading to a decreased understanding of the material.

The use of mobile phones in classrooms for educational purposes is a topic that has received much attention in recent years. On the one hand, proponents of the use of phones in educational settings believe that they can help facilitate learning. For instance, mobile phones can help teachers easily manage class assignments, store student grades, and create collaborative learning opportunities. On the other hand, opponents of phones in classrooms contend that they can negatively affect student learning by becoming a distraction and monitor students’ academic performance. 

Some major arguments against having students use their phones in the classroom are that mobile phones can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on academic tasks, impede students’ ability to engage with course material, and reduce students’ respect for their instructors. Research has shown that the mere presence of mobile phones in the classroom can create an atmosphere of distraction, and divert attention away from course material. This can lead to decreased grades, poor test performance, and a decrease in student-teacher interaction. Furthermore, having confidential student information accessible on phones can reduce student-teacher trust and engagement in the learning process. 

In conclusion, allowing phones in the classroom can have a negative impact on student learning. Mobile phones can be a source of distraction, impede the ability to engage in academic tasks, and diminish respect from student to teacher. While phones can be used in educational settings to create collaboration opportunities, it is important to provide students with guidelines and regulations about the use of phones in the classroom in order to ensure that phones do not become a hindrance to student learning.",AI

One of the main differences between completing high school in three years versus four is the amount of time it takes to reach graduation. While the four year timeline gives students the opportunity to take part in a more extensive extracurricular curriculum -- such as more elective classes, sports, and school clubs -- graduating in three years can provide a chance to speed up the process and get a head start on college or a career. 

However, going through high school in three years can be more stressful and demanding for the student, as more courses will need to be taken in the same amount of time while still leaving time for homework and studying. In addition, there is less time available to form relationships with classmates, participate in extracurriculars, and develop other important social skills. 

Ultimately, it's up to the student to decide which timeline suits their educational goals best. Finishing high school in three years may provide a head start but it also requires a great deal of discipline and hard work. On the other hand, taking four years to finish allows for a less stressful academic load as well as more time to participate in extracurriculars and develop important social skills.",AI

Making decisions for ourselves is an invaluable part of life. It not only helps steer us in the right direction as an individual, but also allows us to have more freedom and independence. However, making our own decisions can also have its drawbacks. One example is found in the story of Generic_Name. Generic_Name relied heavily on someone else to make decisions for them, and in the end faced dire consequences. This example serves to show that when we depend on someone else to make decisions for us, we can be taking away the chance to make our own mistakes and learn from them. Without having a role model in life, it can be difficult to find success. Having a mentor that we can look up to and depend on can be incredibly beneficial, but it also important to trust in our own judgment and rely on ourselves when making decisions. When we make decisions based on our own principles and ideals, it gives us the chance to live and experience life in our own terms, rather than letting other peoples' opinions take precedence. Ultimately, we have to understand that we cannot live life under someone else's rule our entire life, and make decisions that are in our own best interest.",AI

The extended summer break provides students with a much needed respite from challenging studies and the rigors of a school year. Comparing the length of the school year with the length of summer break, it is clear that the break is plenty long enough for students to relax, recharge, and take a break from school. However, should this extended break be extended to other seasons such as fall, winter, and spring? There are potential problems that could compound matters; holidays celebrated in those seasons would reduce the effectiveness of the extended break, and the school year would have to be altered from the current format. Moreover, giving students extra breaks during the year would further disrupt their academic pattern and their performance in a curriculum, compromising their academic progress.",AI

Knowledge is more important than imagination for a variety of reasons. For starters, knowledge is based on facts and evidence, while imagination can be more subjective and open to interpretation. Knowledge is also tangible and constantly evolving, whereas imagination is often grounded in ideas or beliefs that may not necessarily be relevant or even accurate. Moreover, knowledge can be used to solve problems, draw conclusions, and make informed decisions, whereas imagination often seeks to make unpredictable connections and explore ""what-if"" scenarios. In addition, knowledge provides us with a strong foundation to experiment with ideas, whereas imagination is often limited to a single set of circumstances.

This summer, I had the privilege of visiting a small village in South America. Although I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of activities while there, one of the most memorable experiences was learning how to make traditional pottery. I was amazed to discover how much time, hard work and patience goes into making just one pot. I was equally astonished by the intricate designs the potters were able to create. 

The process, which involved mixing clay with water and collecting materials from the local environment, taught me the value of craftsmanship and taking pride in one’s work. It also showed me that even with so few resources, one can still create something of beauty. Observing the dedication of the potters in the village and the joy in their faces when they were able to produce a successful pot, taught me that there is pleasure in working carefully and patiently and that you don’t have to be wealthy to be content.

Dear Local Government,

I am writing to express my strong objections to the proposal of changing the school system from a five-day to a four-day workweek. It is my belief that this will prove to be damaging in a multitude of ways. 

Firstly, the lack of an extra day will drastically cut down the amount of time in the day for students to do their work, test their skills during extracurricular activities, and participate in other academic engagements, making it nearly impossible for them to establish a balance between leisurely activities and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, the truncated amount of time available for learning and growth will reduce the quality of education that the students witness in their respective disciplines.

A four-day school week will also cause undue stress and pressure on students, as all their lessons will be crammed into four days rather than five, making it hard for them to take a break from the workload. Additionally, with the three-day weekend, students may become lethargic and unenthusiastic in learning and developing skills, and gradually become less productive. 

This year’s final exams have shown us how the five-day school week motivates students to become more prepared for the assessments and can help them be ready for the future. Without this extra day, it is likely that student achievement will go down. 

For all these reasons, I urge you not to adopt a four-day work week and to maintain the five-day school week for better academic achievements and continuity. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",AI

Distance education is, without a doubt, a great opportunity for students who are looking for an alternative to traditional learning. It is an innovative and growing form of education that can provide several benefits over traditional learning. There are many reasons why distance learning can be a good option rather than a bad one. 

For students who are being bullied at school, distance learning can provide a sense of security and peace of mind. It allows them to learn in a safe environment and enables them to have more control over their personal schedule, so they can study on their own time without fear of harassment. 

Additionally, distance learning can be immensely advantageous for students who for whatever reason live too far away from their school to attend regularly. It gives students the flexibility to work from anywhere and complete their course work on their own time. 

Moreover, students should consider trying distance learning as it may offer them an opportunity to pursue their educational aspirations and goals with cost efficiency. Although there are costs associated with distance learning, when comparing to the cost of attending a traditional institution, it may be less expensive in the long run. 

In conclusion, distance learning can be a great option for students who are looking for an alternative and cost-effective way to pursue their educational goals. It can provide safety and flexibility to those who are being bullied and those who have limited access to a brick and mortar school. With the variety of benefits distance learning offers, it's worth considering as a viable option.",AI

Honesty is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. In the context of family and friends, being honest can aid in creating a comfortable and trusting bond. As the saying goes, honesty is the best policy. However, while honesty can be an advantage in relationships, it can also be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, speaking honestly can allow family and friends to gain a clear understanding of each other. On the other hand, it can at times lead to hurt feelings, arguments, and other consequences.

Being dishonest, or lying, can be just as damaging. Lying can lead to mistrust both in the present and in the future. It can cause feelings of guilt and anxiety, making communication difficult. Lying can be especially damaging in long-term relationships as people come to doubt the validity of what a person is saying or doing.

Honesty is the key to cultivating and maintaining strong relationships. By speaking honestly and openly, it is easier for family and friends to understand each other and to be more connected. Not only can it lead to respect in relationships, but it also fosters a greater sense of security.

Technology has become an integral part of modern living, and it is difficult to ignore the multitude of ways it has improved our lives. People who are physically limited by their lack of mobility, speech, or hearing can now access communication, information, and services without the limitations of a physical world. Online shopping, for instance, provides an immense convenience that wasn’t available before; buying a book without leaving your house is now a reality. Furthermore, technology has enabled us to connect with people from around the world, allowing us to communicate with near-instantaneous speed. 

Although technology has brought about great strides in our lives, it is important to consider the downsides of this progression. With more communication and information readily available, the value of human contact can be lessened. Face-to-face conversations are becoming more scarce, and the consequences of this could be severe. It is important to learn how to properly utilize technology and its features so that human contact and communication are not lost. 

Ultimately, there is little argument against the fact that technology has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on both our personal and professional lives. It enables us to communicate across long distances in mere seconds and has made the world feel ever-so-slightly smaller. However, it is important to recognize the danger of overreliance and remember that technology is a resource and a tool — one that should be used intelligently and with consideration for its consequences.",AI

Success can be a difficult concept to define, and even more difficult to achieve. While some argue that it is only through the experience of numerous failures that success can be achieved, others assert that success can be achieved even without the hardships of numerous failures. 

Those who argue that success depends on failure cite the fact that failure gives opportunity for growth and insight. With each failure, we come to understand the shortcomings of our plans and can make improvements to find ultimate success. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” This exemplifies how failure can aid us on our path to success.

On the other hand, some people believe that success can be obtained without failure, and point to examples of those who found success without making any serious mistakes. They argue that success can be achieved with hard work, dedication, and perhaps a little luck.

In my opinion, true success is a combination of both failure and success. Without failure, a person may not gain the necessary experience and setback needed to recognize what steps need to be taken in order to succeed. On the other hand, sheer hard work and dedication can help to guide us in the right direction and offer support for our efforts to reach success.",AI

Throughout the past few years, the emergence of technology has opened up a myriad of possibilities for student success both in and out of the classroom. With the introduction of cellphones, specifically, students around the world have the ability to utilize their devices to find resources, complete school assignments, and check their grades whenever and wherever they may be. As a result, allowing cellphones in the classroom for educational purposes has had a number of positive effects on both student achievement and the learning environment. 

First and foremost, allowing cellphones in the classroom can help students to be better organized and complete their assignments more efficiently. For instance, when a student has a question regarding their work, they can quickly access any resources available online for more in-depth information. Moreover, in regards to students who need a refresher on specific material, they could easily find related videos, articles, and other sources to gain a better understanding of their assignments. In addition to this, students could also utilize apps to help manage their time, schedule study sessions, and keep their work organized. 

Furthermore, allowing cellphones in the classroom for educational purposes can also help students feel more at ease in their learning environment. With their devices, students can quickly collaborate with peers to collaborate on projects, ask for help when needed, and send last minute reminders. As a result, students do not have to worry when they may forget something or have a question about an assignment. Furthermore, by having their device at hand, students can easily stay focused and engaged as they will not need to leave the classroom to find resources.

In conclusion, there are many positive effects of allowing students to use their cellphones in classrooms for educational purposes. Not only can students benefit from easy access to online resources, but the use of cellphones in the classroom can also help students better manage their time, collaborate more efficiently with their peers, and feel more comfortable and engaged while learning.",AI

Cellphones are a pervasive technology in our lives today, and new conversations are emerging around their use in the school setting. On one hand, cellphones can have a positive effect on the learning environment by providing students with instant access to information, the ability to collaborate with their peers on projects, and tools to increase their organization and productivity. On the other hand, it is important to consider the potential for cellphones to be distracting, and they may even create an atmosphere of inequity, as some students may not have access to a smartphone or reliable internet connection. 

In order to limit the potential negative impact of cellphones in the classroom, educators can adopt strategies such as setting clear expectations, providing students guidance on how to use their cellphones in an appropriate fashion, and allowing usage only for certain areas of the curriculum. By establishing these strategies, educators can head off potential issues that might arise from allowing students access to their cellphones while in class.",AI

Nobody can deny that growth is a necessary element in our human experience which can affect both our personal and professional lives. The quote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" is a great reminder of how important it is to step out of our comfort zone and take risks in order to progress.

The greatest accomplishments of humanity have come as a result of pushing our boundaries and trying to do something new and challenging. From inventing the telephone, to landing on the moon, to creating revolutionary medical treatments, every groundbreaking development can be traced back to a group of people who decided to move outside of their established skills and take a chance. Even today, entrepreneurs and innovators rely on creative and ambitious risk-taking in order to create businesses, products, and services that solve problems and advance society.

Additionally, there are countless personal success stories of people who took the step to try something new and it changed their lives. From someone who learned a new language, to someone who changed careers, to someone who tried a completely different hobby, each of these individuals had to accept a challenge outside of their existing knowledge before they could experience personal growth. Most of us can look at our own lives and recognize the same kind of successes – be it large or small – that have come from pushing ourselves to do something beyond our current level.

In conclusion, this quote succinctly captures the vital role that striving to accomplish something new and challenging plays in our growth. It is only when we are willing to take risks and learn new things that we can truly expand our capabilities and reach new heights.",AI

Distance learning has become a popular option for many students, and with it, certain risks and benefits arise. While remote learning can offer an accessible and flexible learning experience, it can also have adverse effects on student attendance and cheating. 

When it comes to attendance, many students may find themselves less inclined to actively participate in classes due to lack of in-person interaction. This can result in low levels of engagement, and may lead to poor learning outcomes. Furthermore, there is an increased possibility that students may cheat on tests or quizzes when not supervised by teachers. To counteract this, teachers must find innovative solutions to ensure that students do not take advantage of online learning.

Distance learning can also have an impact on teachers' jobs, as they may feel overworked or lack the freedom to instruct classes in their usual manner. However, when adapted properly, remote learning can be an effective method of teaching that can benefit both teachers and students.

The potential of students dropping out of school while learning from home is also a concern. Without regular attendance or in-person supervision, more students may remain long-term absent from school, impeding their learning progress. Governance must be implemented to ensure distance learning is effective but not abused. 

All in all, while there are risk associated with distance learning, there are also many positive aspects, such as enhanced access to education for students who may otherwise struggle to attend school. With the right strategies in place, distance learning can be a safe and beneficial educational system.",AI

Since the dawn of time, people have realized the immense benefits of helping others. By participating in community service, students gain valuable skills and learn more about their community. But, some argue that this should not be a requirement for students, stating that it is too much work. 

On the one hand, community service is a good way for students to develop important skills such as communication, problem solving, and collaboration. It can also lead to improved student engagement and higher success levels since students are actively involved in their community. Moreover, service activities provide a great way to learn more about the world around them and how they can make a difference.

On the other hand, opponents to mandatory community service argue that it is a burden for students, taking away valuable time that could be spent studying or doing other activities. Additionally, it can be a challenge for students to find community service opportunities that align with their interests and that provide meaningful experiences. 

Ultimately, I believe that requiring students to participate in community service can be beneficial--not only teaching students valuable skills, but also providing them with an opportunity to make a positive impact on their community. By mandating community service, students have the opportunity to contribute to their local community in meaningful ways.",AI

When employers are looking for potential employees, they often look for qualities associated with responsibility and hard work. I have always strived to be a responsible person, and I have several examples of how I have accomplished this. For example, I always complete my tasks accurately and thoroughly, and I try to stay organized by using to-do lists and project timelines. By showing employers how responsible I am with my own work, I can prove that I can be trusted and that I value hard work.

In addition, I have also gained valuable experience through volunteering in various positions. These volunteer experiences have taught me invaluable lessons in time management, multitasking, and problem-solving. Through developing these skills, I have been able to increase my efficiency so I can complete tasks quickly and effectively.

Finally, it's easy to take for granted how important it is to be a hard-worker as opposed to a lazy one. A lazy person may appear unmotivated and may take shortcuts on work, while a hard-worker will go the extra mile. A hard-worker will also be seen as a reliable and trustworthy individual, characteristics that can make them highly desirable to employers.",AI

Assigning electives to high school students can indeed be a powerful tool for improving student motivation, attendance, and grades. As students get to select courses of interest to them, they could become more passionate about attending school and engaged in the learning process. This could result in improved academic outcomes. 

However, one potential drawback is that it may be difficult for students to make the most suitable choices for an elective. As a result, they might end up taking a course that does not keep their interest for long or does not match their level of skills. In addition, it does not necessarily lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the arts, as the student might become too focused on scoring good grades in the course, instead of taking a more holistic approach. 

An alternative approach that could help high school students better understand and appreciate the arts could be to provide an interdisciplinary approach to the learning experience. This could involve teaching students the history, theory, and context of the arts, as well as introducing them to activities such as painting, music, dance, theatre, among others. ",AI

During the darkest times, a positive attitude can be the light that leads the way. A recent example that stands out is the story of my grandmother. Despite her own health battle, she maintained an unwavering brightness that buoyed our family and us. Every day she shared a joke, or a funny story - her attitude as resilient as ever. From her example, I learned the importance of having a positive attitude even during difficult times. 

Having a positive attitude is an important part of managing difficult times, as it fosters resilience and strength. It can be a great source of moral support during difficult situations and can even help bring about concrete solutions to existing problem. Other benefits include better self-care and enhanced mental health. 

Supporting a loved one during a difficult time requires an understanding of their individual needs. One way to do this is to actively listen and provide a shoulder to lean on as they process their emotions. Other ideas include providing helpful advice, if appropriate, or helping them find additional resources, such as therapy or support groups, if needed.  

At the end of the day, having a positive attitude during a difficult time is not easy but is invaluable. It can help an individual continue to have faith in their journey, even in the darkness. It is a reminder that brighter days will be ahead, and it is a reminder to be kind to oneself.",AI

Taking classes from home has become a popular choice for many students who are looking for more flexible options for their learning. On the one hand, students taking classes at home can enjoy the benefits of being able to set their own schedule and being able to work at their own pace. They can access resources more easily, as many online courses provide access to academic materials and other resources. Additionally, online courses have lower tuition and provide an easier learning process. 

However, there are drawbacks to taking courses at home as well. Students may not get the same support they would find in a school setting, such as one-on-one help from the professor or access to tutoring resources. Additionally, online courses require more self-discipline and can be more difficult for students who learn better in a traditional classroom setting. Taking classes from home can also lead to feeling isolated from classmates, which can make it more difficult to engage with the material. 

Overall, there are advantages and drawbacks of taking classes at home versus in school. It is important for students to weigh their options when considering which route to take. That way they can find the learning path that best suits their needs.",AI
"
In recent years, the debate between home schooling versus attending a traditional school has become increasingly prevalent. Both methods of education have their own unique advantages, and choosing which one is right for your specific situation can be a difficult decision. So, what exactly are the benefits of home schooling when compared to traditional schooling?

One of the most obvious benefits of home schooling is customization. Parents who choose this option are able to tailor their children's curriculum to fit their individual needs and abilities. Home schooling allows parents to build a lesson plan that caters to not only their child's strengths, but also focuses on areas that their child needs help with. Additionally, home schooling allows parents to accommodate their children's unique interests and provide advanced instruction in topics of their interest. 

Another major benefit of home schooling is the freedom for learners to work at their own pace. While in traditional school classrooms, teachers are limited to an average set pace that does not cater to students with different learning styles. However, home schooling allows students to slow down and take their time in understanding a concept or to skip ahead if they already possess any prior knowledge. 

Finally, home schooling provides learners with a more flexible schedule and the option to structure learning around other activities. Home schooling gives students the freedom to decide when and where they want to work, making it easier for them to choose hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities. 

Although both traditional school and home schooling have their advantages, those who opt for home schooling are able to take advantage of more individualized and flexible instruction. Home schooling allows learners the freedom to customize their own unique learning experience and create a more personalized educational setting.",AI

For many students, staying two extra hours in school is a challenge. Having an extra two hours tacked onto the regular school day puts an undue burden on students who may already be lacking in energy or time. Having a full day of school can take a toll on students’ physical and mental energy, and asking them to stay two additional hours with limited resources can be overwhelming. 

For instance, students who are already feeling overwhelmed by academic tasks may reach a breaking point when faced with the option of staying for an additional two hours of school. While it may not seem like much time, it can be the tipping point between feeling exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. Moreover, staying an extra two hours in school can also make it more difficult for those with after-school commitments to honor outside obligations or just spend time with family. 

The lack of time and energy can also have a psychological effect on students. If they are not able to stay the extra two hours, they may feel a sense of guilt or disappointment. It can be emotionally challenging for students to leave school in the middle of a lesson and feel like they are letting both themselves and the teacher down. 

In conclusion, staying an extra two hours in school can be an incredibly stressful experience for students who may already be feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage their time and energy. Not being able to stay for those extra two hours can have both physical and psychological consequences. It’s important to remember that everyone copes in different ways and we must take into account students’ individual needs before making decisions about the length of the school day.",AI

Recent studies have revealed that the implementation of a four-day work week can increase productivity among workers, reduce employee turnover, and boost morale. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that such a transition to a four-day school week would bring unpredictable impacts on student academic performance and wellbeing. Without sufficient time allotted to education, schools would be forced to use modern technologies to replace the lessons and activities traditionally conducted throughout a five-day school schedule. The potential outcomes of such a change greatly depend on the capability of technologies to integrate into the learning experience without negatively affecting the quality of education.

Though a four-day school week presents a unique opportunity to students by giving them an extended weekend, there could be risks such as loss of important material due to a compressed learning environment. At the same time, final exams and long-term projects could be challenging due to having only four days to complete them, and a sudden change in routine could pose a barrier to academic success. Ultimately, the pros and cons of a five-day school week need to be compared with those of a four-day school week to determine which is the most suitable for students.",AI

When it comes to achieving success, there are benefits and drawbacks to both working with a group and working alone. Working in a group can bring the advantage of being able to have multiple different perspectives and ideas on how to tackle an issue. This can allow for more thorough and innovative solutions and greater success overall. However, working in a group also tends to require more coordination, and can lead to frustrations due to differing opinions and differences in work styles. 

Working alone can be beneficial in that it allows for uninterrupted focus and the ability to progress quickly. Working by yourself also requires fewer resources, and can lead to achievements faster. On the other hand, working alone can mean less creative input and ideas, as well as little to no external feedback. 

When deciding whether to work alone or in a group, the focus should be on what the individual task or project requires in terms of creative input, feedback, resources, and time constraints. If more perspectives are needed to achieve success, then working in a group may be the best choice. If quick results are desired, then working alone may be the better option.",AI

As technology continues to evolve and education systems become more accessible, more and more students face difficult choices when choosing a career. This is especially true in countries with limited resources, where parents decide what career their children should pursue. This limits young people's opportunities to break out of the cycle of working to make ends meet and prevents them from realizing their true potential. 

For teenagers, it is important to think carefully as they make this decision for themselves. While a good education is generally essential for pursuing a successful career, job opportunities with and without a college degree or diploma may vary depending on the region and the resources available. It is also worth considering what job opportunities the United States may offer. These opportunities can be unique when compared with those in other countries and may provide different paths for teenage students to pursue their passions.

The power of technology has revolutionized the way we learn and access education. With the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) and virtual classrooms, more and more students are choosing to attend their classes at home. This shift in the education system brings with it myriad pros and cons that must be considered. 

On one hand, attending classes at home can make learning more accessible and efficient for students. Freed from the need to commute for long hours to school, they can make better use of their time and have more flexibility. Additionally, virtual classrooms allow students to form meaningful connections with peers, making class participation more engaging.

In a world of constant comparison and criticism, it can be difficult to stay true to yourself. Being ourselves in a society that is constantly trying to push us to fit into certain standards and expectations is no easy feat. This challenge can come with both rewards and consequences. On one hand, standing up for our beliefs and embracing our true selves can lead to a greater sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction. On the other hand, refusing to conform to certain societal norms can lead to isolation and judgment.

Regardless of the potential risks, embracing one’s true self can be one of the strongest steps we take towards building meaningful relationships and renegotiating our own identity. By ceasing to strive for perfection and instead accepting one’s flaws and traits, we open ourselves up to those around us in the hopes of fostering more genuine connections. In contrast, a rigid code of standards and adherence to traditional ideas of beauty can alienate us and limit our potential.

It is essential to take responsibility for our individual identities and never lose sight of our own values. Through the promotion of self-acceptance we can achieve unity, not uniformity.

I am passionate about expressing my creativity through various types of art, such as painting, drawing, and photography. I have enjoyed researching how art pieces are sold and the value that they can currently bring in the market. But I understand that creating art is not always easy. It requires a lot of patience and practice, and even then mistakes may be encountered. However, I have found that with enough perseverance, these mistakes can transform into successes. Furthermore, I enjoy keeping the pieces I create as a memory and sometimes giving them to family members, with the cost being worth it for the special connection it creates. Continuing to explore new ideas and techniques has been a worthwhile journey.",AI

When facing adversity and failure, many of us give up in discouragement and despair. However, embracing the importance of enthusiasm can be the key factor to finding success. Enthusiasm not only gives us strength to persevere in difficult situations, but it also brings creative thinking and allows us to come up with innovative solutions to our challenges.

I remember my own experience of failure: I worked hard for months on a science project to present in my final exam. When I got my results back, I found out I had failed. At that moment I felt like my world had come crashing down, and I was all set to give up and abandon my dream of becoming a scientist. But then I thought of all the enthusiasm I had put in during the months of hard work, and of my parents’ faith in my ambition. All of a sudden I was filled with a renewed enthusiasm and I was determined to try again. I poured my energy and enthusiasm into the project and ultimately, I was willing to take the risk of success or failure and I passed the exam with higher than expected results. 

This illustrates that enthusiasm can be the foundation for achieving success in times of failure. Whether it is a school assignment, a job, a career, or even a simple hobby; having a strong enthusiasm will help build inner strength and courage to push our boundaries and rise to success.",AI

One of the most famous individuals who has achieved success by being unapologetically themselves is Ellen DeGeneres. DeGeneres courageously came out as a lesbian on her show in 1997, setting an example for many people to follow. Her unique sense of humor and upbeat attitude has earned her much admiration in the entertainment industry even after coming out.

What makes this individual stand out is her willingness to be vulnerable and authentic to her fans. DeGeneres never shied away from showing who she truly is, despite the risk that it could have cost her endorsements and fans. This demonstrates the risk-benefit of wanting to be just like someone else versus following the crowd. 

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson’s advice concerning the importance of being yourself has been echoed throughout the years. He states, ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" 

Surprisingly, the most important requirement for achieving success in life is much less complicated than trying to be just like someone else or following the crowd. It is to be true to yourself—take the path that is unique to you. Being true to yourself requires the courage to face fears and reject the expectations placed on us by society. By being honest with yourself and setting your own expectations, you can be content with who you are and discover the valuable role that you can play in improving the world. 

In conclusion, the importance of being yourself should never be underestimated. Despite the risks and pressures of society, it is essential to embrace one’s own unique qualities and dreams. Only then can one discover true freedom and success.",AI

When it comes to the debate of whether or not after school homework club should be allowed in our schools, there are compelling arguments against it. It has been shown to negatively impact family time, significantly reduce the potential for sports and activities, and limit gaming opportunities. 

Take the situation of Joe, for instance. Joe had been trying to make time to attend his daughter's piano recital the past few weeks, but had to keep missing it due to the demands of his after school homework club. His daughter was disappointed and he had to miss the one thing he was looking forward to. 

Similarly, Sarah was asked to leave her basketball team on account of her having to attend her after school homework club every day. Despite being an ace player, she was unable to participate in the game due to her class-like commitment to her after school homework club. 

Finally, there's Toni, who had been taking a break from her after school homework club one day to enjoy her favorite video game. She was about to reach new levels when her friends in her after school homework club group chat asked where she was. Due to the fear of being criticized for not fulfilling her commitment, she gave up her beloved gaming session, as well as potentially losing out on new subscribers to her YouTube channel.

Imposing curfews on teenagers is often a contentious issue, as the traditional age for adolescence brings with it a desire to explore the world around them and establish independence. A 10pm weekday curfew and midnight weekend curfew can make it difficult for teenagers to socialize with their peers, leading them to stay out late in an effort to spend as much time as possible with their friends. In addition, some teenagers may try to circumvent their curfews by sneaking out after the time limit has been set and attempt to sneak back in before their parents wake up. Not adhering to a curfew may also cause tension between teenagers and their parents, as well as potential trouble with the authorities if curfew violations are reported.

Working in a group can be incredibly beneficial compared to working alone. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions. For example, when I was working on a group project in college, I had the benefit of working alongside three other students who each had their own area of expertise. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. 

Furthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized. Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. With proper planning and communication, disagreements and wasted time can be minimized, allowing groups to maximize their effectiveness. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks.",AI

The renowned British statesman Winston Churchill once famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” His words express a powerful idea: that failure is essential for success. This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. In order for us to reach our goals, it is inevitable that we will experience failure along the way. This should be embraced, rather than feared, as failure often gives us insight and teaches us valuable lessons. We should use this knowledge to help power us towards our ultimate goals. 

The key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress. With each failure, we gain more experience and knowledge which can be used on our journey to success. Viewing failure in a positive light allows us to stay motivated and benefit from the lessons learned. Having a strong mindset and the right attitude can be the difference between succeeding and throwing in the towel.

The debate between a hard working attitude and a positive attitude is one that has been pursued for ages. While it is true that positive thinking can yield many rewards, most would agree that possessing a hard working attitude is often much more beneficial in achieving success in life. Success requires dedication, perseverance and hard work, and a hard working attitude will provide these traits when facing any challenge. 

Having a hard work attitude allows an individual to take action and turn ambition into reality rather than feelings of lofty aspirations. A hard working attitude involves taking personal responsibility, setting meaningful goals, and putting the necessary amount of effort and time towards arriving at the desired outcome. It fosters a sense of relentless determination in spite of failure and requires strength of character and an unwillingness to give up. 

A hard worker will also be more accountable for their failures and successes. They will strive to learn from their mistakes and seek to improve on them, rather than simply making excuses and blaming external forces. This is the kind of attitude that will ultimately be beneficial for any individual striving to reach their goals in life.

Ultimately, having a hard working attitude is essential for self-improvement and advancement, which are essential components in achieving success in life. Possessing a hard working attitude will allow an individual to continue to strive for excellence and be rewarded with accomplishments they can be proud of.

It is easy to think that in order to be successful in life, we must put our own individual preferences and values to the side in order to focus solely on goal achievement. However, it is important to remember that in order to be truly successful, it is essential to stay true to ourselves. It is only when we embrace our unique qualities and abilities that we can make the most out of our lives, achieve our goals, and enjoy true satisfaction in life. 

One of the most important things to keep in mind is that success looks different for everyone. What works for one person may not work for another, so it’s important to keep an open mind and recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all formula for success. We must find our own way to achieve our goals while being true to ourselves. This means being honest about who we are, our goals, our passions, and our values. Only then can we truly commit to our goals and make meaningful progress. 

Another key to success is having a clear and achievable plan. It is essential to set realistic targets and take action to reach them. We should also be mindful of our strengths and weaknesses, as such knowledge can help shape our plans.

The American Revolution was a pivotal moment in history, ushering in a new era of freedom and democracy. Two of its figures, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, played an important role in shaping the course of the Revolution. Jefferson was a noted author and philosopher, whose thorough analysis of the injustices endured by the British colonies ultimately inspired many of his fellow patriots to take up arms and fight for independence. His writings, such as the Declaration of Independence, left a lasting mark on the history and values of the United States. 

In a famous quote, Jefferson famously said, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,"" which reaffirmed the ideals of freedom and justice for all. His words served to unite the patriots in their cause, creating a strong sense of purpose and commitment.

John Adams, too, was greatly influenced by his experience in the American Revolution. His writing during the war, particularly in his Thoughts on Government, outlined his views on how human rights and the rule of law should be preserved and upheld in the new nation. Through his writings, Adams spoke to the importance of a just and equitable government, and of the need for individuals to be allowed to secured their natural rights.

Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were two of the most influential Founding Fathers.

Online classes provide an interesting way for students to learn, allowing them to access content at any time and on any device. Nevertheless, there are both pros and cons to taking classes online, which are particularly evident when considering the effects of these classes on students of different ages. 

The primary advantage to taking classes online is accessibility. For younger students, such as those in kindergarten or elementary school, electronic devices may mean access to better educational content than what is available in the classroom. Additionally, online classes allow students to remain in school even during the event of an unexpected illness or family conflict. In these cases, online classes give students the ability to remain “in class” without having to leave the comfort of their own homes. 

However, there are also various disadvantages to taking classes online. Perhaps most significantly, the cost of tuition for these classes may be exceptionally high, making it difficult for those with limited financial resources to access the content. Furthermore, access to the internet and necessary electronic devices can be a challenge, as not all students have access to these items. For those who do, these costly items may need to be regularly updated in order to remain compatible with upcoming lessons. 

Overall, taking classes online has its positives and negatives. Although many students find great benefit in taking classes online due to convenience, cost and access, it is important to consider the varying degrees of difficulty in terms of access to technology and tuition. By doing so, each individual student will be able to decide whether online classes are the best fit for their own needs.",AI

At the Seven Oaks School, students must choose the courses for their chosen profession at an early age. This practice has both pros and cons for both the students and their parents. 

On the plus side, this system allows the students to get more in-depth experience in the field they’ve chosen. It also allows the school to tailor its teaching efforts to the needs of the student body since it will already know the courses that need to be taught.

However, this system of course selection can be limiting for students. If their interests or ambitions change over time, they may not have the opportunity to sample courses outside of their chosen profession. Additionally, even when students want to pursue a different career, they may be forced to take courses for their chosen profession.

It is therefore important to weigh the pros and cons before implementing a system of mandatory course selection.

Allowing students to choose their courses late in their high school career gives them an opportunity to delve into different fields and discover their true passions.",AI

In our daily lives, we are always encouraged to keep busy and to reach for bigger and better things. While completing tasks and taking on projects, we can certainly accomplish a lot, there is also much to be said about moments of inactivity and stillness. Inactivity offers the chance for reflection, rest, and a chance to practice mindfulness. 

For example, take the physical activity of yoga. Intentional pauses are taken between poses and postures, which allow for deep breathing, calming the mind and emotions, and balance. Those moments of inactivity help to create a balanced experience and provide an opportunity for increased strength and flexibility, which is the overall goal of yoga. 

Similarly, research has shown that pauses in work-related activities are beneficial. These short rests are believed to increase productivity and allow for better and more creative solutions. In preventing feelings of burn-out, moments of inactivity can lead to a higher quality of the work we produce and more job satisfaction.

Distance learning has been an attractive option for many students who have disabilities or who don't enjoy traditional school. It allows these students to access educational opportunities without having to navigate the many obstacles they often face in a physical classroom setting. 

The benefits of distance learning for students with disabilities are numerous and include increased access to educational materials, personalized instruction, and a greater sense of independence. Firstly, students with disabilities are often subject to limited accessibility issues in traditional school, such as limited access to materials or physical spaces. Through distance learning, these students can access educational materials on their own time, when and where it is most convenient for them to do so. 

In addition, distance learning programs provide personalized instruction suited to each student's individual needs. With online teachers readily available to offer help and assistance when needed, students can tailor their learning experience to their own strengths and weaknesses. This can provide a sense of control for students with disabilities, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that works best for them. 

Finally, distance learning gives students with disabilities more autonomy and independence. They no longer need to worry about transporting themselves to traditional school, dealing with the possibility of bullying or discrimination, or keeping up with a strict school schedule. Instead, they can learn on their own time, on their own terms, reducing feelings of helplessness and frustration. 

In conclusion, distance learning is a beneficial and valuable resource for students with disabilities or students who may not feel like they fit into traditional school. With greater access, personalization, and autonomy, these students can gain the education and confidence they need to flourish.",AI

Music, drama, and art classes have long been required in many schools, but it is worth questioning whether these are essential courses for students to take. It can be argued that these classes should be electives rather than required courses.

First, in many cases these classes can be pointless for some students. For instance, a student who does not have an inclination or desire to learn an instrument or create art may go through the motions without actually absorbing the material or making any real progress. For some, these classes can become a chore and not a source of joy or learning.

Second, music, drama, and art classes can be unfair for students with different abilities. Many creative subjects necessitate creativity, skill, and/or talent to excel, something which not all students have. Forcing less-able students to take these classes can result in them feeling isolated and unable to keep up with their peers.

Finally, these classes are not always necessary when it comes to achieving education goals. Classes such as English, Math, and Science are vital in order to acquire qualifications and pass standardized tests, which can lead to future career opportunities. While learning about music, drama, and art can be enjoyable, they are not always the most important classes for students to take.

In conclusion, music, drama, and art classes should not be required, and should instead be offered as electives. These classes can be irrelevant or difficult for some students, and are not always the most important when it comes to pursuing an education.",AI

First impressions are made quickly and can have lasting impacts on relationships and our view of the world. While first impressions are vital, they are not always an accurate representation of someone or something. First impressions are based on our own personal biases, assumptions, and judgments, which can lead to a distorted initial assessment. 

For example, a prospective employer might make an overly critical judgment of a job applicant because of the way he or she dresses or talks. This impression could lead to an automatic rejection, despite the applicant's potential qualifications and good character. In this case, our first impression of the applicant is based on superficial factors and does not truly reflect his or her true worth. 

Although first impressions are difficult to avoid, we can learn to question our initial thoughts and judgments. We can open our minds to multiple perspectives and put in effort to get to know someone or something better in order to form a more accurate understanding. Through sustained interactions and personal experiences, we can revise our first impressions and gain a more realistic picture of reality. 

Thus, initial impressions are not always reliable and can be changed by developing a deeper level of understanding. It is important to recognize our own weaknesses in forming those initial impressions and take the initiative to revisit our assumptions in order to form fair and accurate judgments.",AI

Advisers and mentors, especially those who have experienced what we are going through, can provide invaluable insight and advice. They are often the best source of relevant and objective advice. This can be particularly advantageous to those facing difficult life decisions, as expert guidance can help to identify and weigh up options.  

Furthermore, having someone to turn to when looking for guidance can give us the confidence and reassurance we need to make a decision with courage and conviction. It can also be beneficial for gaining the experience and knowledge necessary to make our own decisions in the future.

However, it’s important to remember that in some cases, relying on someone else's advice can limit our own ability to think independently and form our own decisions. Too much advice and guidance can make it difficult to develop our own problem-solving skills, and taken too far, this could be detrimental to our development as autonomous individuals. Additionally, in some cases, seeking guidance from an expert can leave us feeling misguided and confused if their advice does not lead us in the right direction. It is therefore always important to consider the merits of both options when making any major decision in life.",AI

People should make their own decisions because it gives them the freedom to act according to their own values and interests. When people make their own decisions, they take responsibility for their own successes and failures, and learn to live with the consequences of their choices. This is a powerful form of self-empowerment, and can help people to become independent and confident. 

In contrast, if people rely on others to make decisions for them, they surrender any control they might have. They become dependent and are likely to feel powerless and frustrated when they don't get what they want. Making their own decisions allows people to have a sense of ownership over their life, and gives them the ability to direct their own course. 

When people make their own decisions, they are more likely to come up with solutions that are right for them. Instead of relying on the judgment of others, they are free to evaluate the situation from their own perspective and find the best solution. This allows them to create a life that meets their needs and goals, and to take ownership of their lives in a meaningful way. 

Ultimately, making their own decisions gives people the freedom to live their life according to the values and principles that they believe in. It allows them to move forward with certainty and purpose, and to create a life that is totally unique to them. Making their own decisions is undoubtedly the best way for people to take control of their destiny and live a life of fulfillment.",AI

In recent years, the use of technology and digital resources have influenced how people interact with one another. Examples such as Google Translator, Google, and YouTube have become more commonplace in our day-to-day lives, making it increasingly easy to influence someone without having to use physical examples. However, there are still many other ways to influence someone without relying on examples, such as verbal communication and body language. 

Verbal communication and body language are still effective means for conveying thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Through the use of words, facial expressions, and gestures, people can easily communicate their desires to one another without being constrained by the need to provide examples or visuals. Even when someone may not understand the language of the speaker, these other forms of communication can still serve to influence. 

While technology and digital resources are convenient and often times helpful when trying to influence someone, they should not be relied upon as the only means. There is much to be said for considering other options such as verbal communication and body language, as the impact they have on the listener should not be trivialized. By understanding the many ways in which we can influence someone, we can better equip ourselves with the knowledge and resources needed to effectively communicate our ideas and intentions without using tangible examples.",AI

Graduating early can be a great opportunity to jumpstart one's dream job or start college earlier. Completing a four-year program in a shorter period of time is a testament to a student's dedication, ambition, and discipline. Financially, graduating early can mean saving money on tuition and room and board fees, as well as less money spent on textbooks and other supplies. 

At the same time, graduating early can be more difficult in terms of academic rigor and personal challenge. Not only does it require taking extra classes, but it also requires more intense studying time and a more disciplined approach to course selection. It can also lead to a feeling of academic burnout earlier than normal. 

When weighing the pros and cons of graduating early, it is important for each individual to take into account their own academic and financial situation, as well as their own feelings of academic burnout. Ultimately, each student should decide whether graduating early is the appropriate decision for them. Graduating early does not necessarily guarantee a better education than the standard four-year plan; rather, each student should choose the path that best meets their individual needs and goals.",AI

Failure can be a great teacher, even when it has a discouraging effect in the short-term. Attitude and enthusiasm are essential when it comes to turning failure into success. Having a positive attitude and approach to life will make it easier to accept setbacks and look at them as learning opportunities. It's important to remember that failing doesn't mean you're a ""failure"" — mistakes and failure are part of the process of growth and success. Going into unfamiliar territory can be intimidating, but having enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn can open doors and make it much easier to adjust and grow.

For example, let's say you're starting a business. Mistakes are unavoidable, but instead of getting discouraged and giving up, embracing failure and learning from it can open up opportunities and relationships that couldn’t have been found any other way. The most successful entrepreneurs will often talk about the successes that came from failing — failing fast, learning from their mistakes, and applying that knowledge to build a successful business. 

In conclusion, failure and success are not mutually exclusive — accepting mistakes and having an eagerness to learn from them can often be the key to achieving success. Failure shouldn't be feared, but should be embraced as part of the learning process that ultimately leads to success.",AI

Growing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin—a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers.  

I eagerly signed up for violin lessons. However, I soon realized that learning to play the violin is an incredibly taxing process that requires immense dedication, time, and focus to become proficient. You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument. Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. Today, I am able to take immense joy in playing the violin, something that I never imagined I would be doing.",AI

Having a positive attitude is an essential part of life, it allows us to make the best of every situation and gives us the strength to push through hardship. On a general level, having a positive attitude in life leads to greater success and better mental and physical health. Having a positive attitude within the home has the ability to create a harmonious and vibrant environment, in which family relationships can flourish.

I once had a coworker who has a consistently positive outlook on life, no matter how challenging a situation we found ourselves in. His attitude made the job easier and encouraged teamwork, even during difficult days. His positivity made the workplace a more pleasant atmosphere, leading to improved morale.

On the other hand, lacking a positive attitude in any situation can have dire consequences. It can lead to unhappiness, stress, low self-esteem and negativity that can spread to those around us. The lack of a positive attitude can also reduce productivity and lead to a lack of motivation and ambition. In the end, having a positive attitude is essential in any life situation, and its importance cannot be underestimated.",AI

The debate surrounding online learning has grown in recent years with a variety of countries and schools considering it a viable educational option. However, there are some countries and schools which do not allow online learning and it is important to understand the consequences students face as a result. Technological capabilities in some of these countries may be limited which could be a contributing factor, however, it is important to note that online learning is not a viable option for all students no matter the technological capabilities of the countries in which they reside. 

The benefits of online learning compared to traditional, in-person schooling are no doubt significant. Online learning grants students much greater flexibility and allows them to engage in educational pursuits from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, online learning is often less costly than traditional in-person schooling since there are no geographic boundaries and students have access to a much larger variety of courses. 

However, online learning does come with its fair share of disadvantages. Students in traditional schooling benefit greatly from the social interaction with their peers, something which is not easily replicated in an online environment despite the advances in technology. Furthermore, the technological equipment required for an optimal online learning experience is often quite expensive. Additionally, some students may not take the online education seriously and be less likely to put in the appropriate effort needed for success. 

Finally, it is important to note that online learning can have many positive outcomes for those who are unable to attend school due to illness or other extenuating circumstances. These individuals can still take part in educational pursuits from the convenience of their own home. It is clear that online learning offers a variety of benefits, both for those who are able to take part in traditional schooling, as well as those who are unable to due to special circumstances.",AI

In today's ever-evolving world, having an array of different skills is essential in order to excel in the workforce. Knowing multiple skills can help increase your employability, broaden your scope of opportunities, and give you a better chance of achieving success. 

Having a variety of skills allows you to move between different job roles comfortably, and find the one that best suits your needs. This could mean that you are able to go from a job in accounting to a role in marketing, or from designing websites to writing copy.

Having a positive attitude in life plays an important role in one's personal and professional success. Studies have found that positive attitudes can increase self-esteem, create more meaningful relationships, lead to better health and help build resilience in the face of life's struggles. There are many examples of successful people who have demonstrated the power of a positive attitude to shape their lives. For instance, Steve Jobs was famously known to have a strong optimistic outlook, which is often argued to be one of the key contributors to his success. 

At the same time, many argue that there is no single key to success and it is more important to focus on skills and hard work than attitude or outlook. There are countless unreliable biographies, for example, of famous people claiming to have an unattainable positive outlook that was responsible for their success.

Ultimately, having a positive attitude is important for success in life, but it is not the only factor. It can help in certain ways - like fostering a healthy self-esteem and helping build healthy and supportive relationships - but it cannot entirely replace hard work and preparation. Success is the result of the combination of all of these elements.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said, “By growth we mean the enlargement of our powers and facilities, the opening to us of vaster resources of action.” To him, and many others, mastering a skill as part of the process of self-improvement and growth is essential. Mastery of a skill, whether related to a profession or not, can lead to immense personal and professional growth.

For instance, investing a significant amount of time to learning a new language as a hobby has unlocked a wide range of opportunities for me personally. It has opened up new job prospects, made me more marketable for employers, and enabled me to move in more global circles. Similarly, learning a complex craft such as knitting or woodworking provided me with a sense of personal satisfaction and increased confidence.

However, growth is not limited to mastering a skill. It is possible for someone to become a wiser, more self-aware individual and grow without mastering any particular skill. Bill Gates echoes this sentiment and states, “It’s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure. Learning what not to do is sometimes more important than learning what to do.” Taking the time to reflect on life experiences helps to inform decisions in the future and can assist in personal growth.",AI

Graduating high school in three years and entering college or the work force one year early is an increasingly popular option amongst students. By putting in the effort to bypass traditional high school curriculums, students are able to enter college or the work force at an earlier age, thereby giving them a head start over those who are the same age but stuck in high school for the standard four years.

In terms of the effort required to achieve this goal, the most important is to be organized and dedicated. Early grads need to stay focused and be willing to take more courses in any given semester to compensate for the lack of time. They may also need to be flexible in their approach to the different classes they take, and take online or other external classes to fully fill out the requirements.

The advantages of graduating early are manifold. Firstly, students are able to enter college or the job market one year early. This means they are more likely to secure a well-paying job and also have the opportunity to advance more quickly in their career. Furthermore, since many college credits can be earned at the high school level, early grads may be able to take on full-time college courses during their first year of college. This could potentially save them a significant amount of money since they would not have to spend the full four years of college tuition.

Thus, it is clear that graduating high school in three years and entering college or the work force one year early can be a beneficial decision for motivated and organized students. The payoff of being able to enter college or the job market more quickly is likely to outweigh the effort required to achieve this goal, leading to a more successful future.",AI

First impressions are often crucial in forming relationships and opinions; we make snap judgements, believing that our initial thoughts about new acquaintances are accurate, as if our minds were solely made up shortly after meeting someone. However, throughout the course of a relationship, these first impressions can and usually do change over time. 

Take for instance my experience with my former neighbor. When I first moved to the area, I had no clue who lived in the house next to me. Several weeks later, I finally mustered up the courage to introduce myself, and to my surprise, my neighbor was not the snobby person I had labeled her as from afar. Come to find out, she was a kind, outgoing woman and we quickly became friends. I was so taken aback by the difference in my preconceived notions that I began to ponder the power of first impressions.

Likewise, we often have wonderful experiences from second chances, such as when we return to a restaurant, after having a bad time the first. In the case of the aforementioned restaurant, the second time around, the waiter was a lot friendlier, the food was much tastier, and the ambiance was a lot more pleasant. This serves as a reminder that – while it’s important to go into a situation with an open mind – it’s not always wise to judge a book by its cover.

The idea of first impressions can be beneficial in the sense that it gives us the opportunity of keeping an open mind regarding people and places. For instance, I would have never connected with my neighbor had I stayed within the confines of my own presumptions regarding her. Furthermore, my second-time visit to the restaurant provided me with a great night out, and I now consider it one of my favorite spots. 

Overall, our initial thoughts of new acquaintances, places, and experiences are important. However, they don’t always tell the entire story, and thus it’s important to remember that first impressions can and do change over time, offering us the chance to benefit from second chances.",AI

In today's ever-changing world, student community service should be mandatory in the school setting in order to provide our young people with the opportunity to make a lasting, positive impact on their communities. Studies have shown that student community service can have a positive impact on student learning, teacher effectiveness, student engagement, and the overall environment of the community. 

Student community service can help give students a better understanding of the world around them. Being exposed to situations outside one’s classroom gives students a real-world understanding of how to apply their knowledge and skills. This can have a profound effect on their learning, as research has shown that those who are involved in community service and volunteering are more likely to stay in school and become successful adults later in life. 

Teachers can also benefit from requiring their students to participate in voluntary services. It allows them to get out of the classroom and get a better understanding of the issues and needs that exist in their community. By doing so, they are able to better equip their students with the skills and tools to serve their community in meaningful and impactful ways. 

Student engagement is also improved when they are given the opportunity to take part in voluntary service. Studies have found that students who are engaged in service activities tend to have higher GPAs, are more likely to graduate, and are more likely to be successful in college and in the workforce. 

Finally, student community service has been found to have a positive impact on the overall environment of the community. When students get involved in the community, they are more likely to be engaged in civic life, leading to increased understanding and appreciation of diversity. This in turn has been linked to reduced violence, improved economic development, and increased social connectedness. 

In conclusion, student community service should be mandated in the school setting in order to create more meaningful opportunities for students, teachers, and the community at large to do good and be successful. By requiring student service, we can tap into the potential of our youth to create change and make a lasting difference in our communities.",AI

In recent years, taking courses online from home has become increasingly popular for many students. Studying from home has numerous benefits that may make it better suited to certain individuals than attending school in person. For starters, online courses offer convenience and flexibility. Those with physical impairments or other long-term health issues can participate in classes without having to worry about getting to and from school. Additionally, there is often more variety when it comes to what courses are available online. For students who may be struggling academically, online courses allow for a more individualized learning experience and can provide extra help when needed.

However, there are also some clear advantages to attending school in person. In a regular school environment, students get the opportunity to learn social skills and work with classmates on group projects. Interacting with peers and teachers on a daily basis can be beneficial for developing important skills like collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Additionally, attending school in person can provide a sense of routine and can create a more rewarding educational experience. By taking part in classroom discussions and physical activities, students can gain a better understanding of the material they are studying. 

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to deciding between online courses and in-person education. It is important to consider both options seriously and factor in each student's individual abilities and preferences. Some may find that taking courses online from home is a better fit, while others may prefer the traditional school experience.",AI

For those looking to be successful in multiple careers, research is essential. It takes a lot of effort to learn the skills needed and stay on top of ever-changing trends within each industry. In addition to research, a practical way to gain the necessary skills is to try a recipe or activity that you have never done before and practice it to perfect your skills. 

Experimenting with new things can often increase our self-confidence because we gain a sense of accomplishment in learning something new. Exploring and learning new activities can also help increase our knowledge and grow our skill sets. Additionally, failure can be seen as a learning opportunity, where we can take something away from the experience, while gaining the confidence to attempt such endeavours again. 

By studying the experiences of someone with multiple careers, it is possible to take away valuable information on how they managed to move between each different career and succeed. This knowledge can then be used to develop and form our own career plan. Nevertheless, it is essential to remember the importance of research and the willingness to experience something new in order to be successful in multiple careers.",AI

One of the greatest gifts life has given me is the wisdom of my family. My parents and my sister have been giving me advice since I was a young child, and the lessons they shared with me have served me well throughout my life.

My mom has always told me to never give up, no matter what situation I face. She taught me that hard work and perseverance will always pay off, and to never be discouraged by failure. I've seen the power of this advice in my own life time and again; whenever I've faced a challenge I've never hesitated to keep going.

My dad's wisdom lies in showing me the value of gratitude. He taught me to always be grateful, even when life doesn't seem to be going my way. I try to remind myself of this during the toughest of times, and it always brings me back to a place of appreciation.

My sister has perhaps the most meaningful advice of all: to always be true to myself. Growing up surrounded by expectations, it was often hard to decipher what exactly was true to me. But my sister's words of wisdom are something I cling to, and I remind myself of them whenever I find myself struggling with making the right decision.

The wisdom of my family has been with me since I was young, and shapes my outlook on life even today. I'm so grateful to have a support system I can turn to in times of need, and the advice I've been given will continue to be a driving force in my life for years to come.",AI

Although a C average may not seem like an impressive academic achievement, it does not necessarily reflect the potential of the student. In fact, some students with a C average can achieve great success if given the opportunity. For these students, extra help and a chance to take part in activities can be especially beneficial. 

With the agreement of the student, parents and teachers, these activities may include extra tutoring, field trips, and group projects. These types of activities can help these students learn the necessary skills they need to succeed in school. For example, a field trip can open new doors of knowledge, while a group project can help the student learn how to collaborate effectively. Extra tutoring can also show the student new subject materials or help them bolster their understanding of a certain topic.

Praising students when their work has not yet reached its full potential has both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, praising students for their effort can boost their self-confidence and encourage them to persist in the face of disappointment. It can also serve as a way of rewarding a student for engagement with the task, regardless of outcome. On the other hand, praise which is given too freely can result in students forming the belief that hollow compliments will be rewarded, instead of hard work. It can also lead to unrealistic expectations about performance, creating a false sense of confidence which will inevitably be crushed in the face of more significant challenges. 

When used in moderation, however, praising students for effort can be beneficial. Rather than expecting students to always achieve an ""A"" grade, recognizing worthy effort helps to foster a growth mindset, enabling students to realize that mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. It also encourages positive self-reflection, with students becoming more self-aware and mindful of the work that has been put in. 

Overall, it is clear that praising students for their efforts, even when their work has not reached its full potential, is a delicate balance. Used constructively, it can motivate and reward, but overused it can create excessive expectations and detract from meaningful learning.  ",AI

The world is a complex place and, oftentimes, there is no better guide through life than a loving parent or guardian. Throughout our lives, as we experience the highs and lows of life, wisdom and experience from those who have gone before us can be invaluable. For this reason, it is important to obtain wisdom and experience from a parent or guardian.

For the younger generation, the guidance of a parent or guardian can help them make wise decisions, especially during times of adversity. With practical wisdom and life experience, these mentors can help advise through difficult decisions—from the small but significant ones in teenage life such as career choices, to the bigger life decisions such as sorting out relationships and financial management.

Finally, as children become adults, having someone with experience to act as a sounding board to discuss career opportunities, sports, social situations, and relationships, can be key to making wise choices. A parent or guardian who is wise and experienced can help a young adult tap into their strengths and teach them how to find and develop wisdom.

To sum up, wisdom and experience from a parent or guardian can be invaluable. While a young person might be more independent, those with parents or guardians to help guide them on their journey will have a much greater chance of success and fulfillment in life.",AI

Sports activities are an essential part of physical and mental development in young people. Unfortunately, access to these activities is often limited when students are required to achieve a certain grade in order to participate. This is an unfair practice, for several reasons.

First, it sets up a false dichotomy between academics and athletics, an artificial separation that should not exist. Students should be encouraged to excel in both areas. Sports, in particular, can foster resilience and provide a constructive outlet for frustration or disappointment with academic performance.

Second, using grades to limit athletics unfairly disadvantages those students who are already at a disadvantage. The flip side of this coin is that students who already excel in academics are given extra incentive to keep up their performance, while students who struggle are left behind.

Finally, and most importantly, sports activities help young people develop lifelong skills and friendships. These experiences should not be denied to students based on one area of performance. Athletics is an essential part of holistic education, and too often we forget to think of it as such.

For these reasons, it is highly unfair to limit access to sports based on grade requirements. It is our job as educators to ensure that all students have equal opportunity to participate.",AI

No one has ever achieved success without making some mistakes along the way. Failure and setbacks are part of life, and how we respond to them can often determine our final success. History is full of examples of people who have had to overcome failure and struggle in order to achieve their goals. Take the example of Mahatma Gandhi: Though he had faced numerous setbacks throughout his lifetime, he never gave up and eventually achieved India's independence from Britain in 1947. His refusal to accept failure and continued perseverance eventually led to his success.

Another inspiring example is that of Marie Curie, who won two Nobel Prizes despite facing significant gender-based obstacles. She overcame numerous failures throughout her life, and ultimately achieved tremendous success due to her persistence and unwavering determination. Her story highlights how no amount of failure should ever hold someone back from their dreams.

These examples show that failure can actually be a key driver towards success. It can provide invaluable lessons and the opportunity to learn from our mistakes. The most successful people in the world have likely faced numerous failures throughout their lives, but their willingness to take risks and never give up has ultimately enabled them to lead happy and successful lives. It's important to keep in mind that failure is never an excuse for giving up — but instead, it should be seen as an opportunity to learn, grow, and ultimately, reach success.",AI

As someone who has experienced failure on numerous occasions, I must say I agree with Winston Churchill's statement that success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasm. Throughout my life, I have learned that every time I have faced a difficult challenge or failed at something, I have become a stronger and more resilient person. Each failure has provided me with the tools and experiences necessary to better persevere and face the next challenge. 

For example, in high school, I applied to college and was rejected. Although it wasn't what I wanted at the time, the experience taught me that failure is not the end of the world. Instead, I applied to more schools, studied harder, and took on more extracurricular activities. In the end, I was accepted to my dream school and graduated with honors. 

All of this is to say that failure is an integral part of life and if accepted and embraced can be turned into success. Most of my successes have been a result of my ability to keep pushing forward despite my many failures and lack of enthusiasm.

Completing high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 can offer many benefits, both professionally and personally. For those who opt to complete their secondary education at a younger age, they will have access to an array of longer professional fields to explore, and potentially even establish themselves within sooner than their peers. This could be in fields such as entrepreneurship, coding, web development, project management, analytics, or consulting. The early completion of high school will also open up the doors to more personal opportunities. As a young adult, there are many opportunities for travel, volunteer work, internships, apprenticeships, or even higher education to pursue. Being young allows the individual more freedom to explore and do more in life. Additionally, younger adults are physically stronger and more resilient, allowing them to take on more physically-demanding jobs.",AI

    Ralph Waldo Emerson once famously said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” This statement epitomizes the importance of individuality in life, as it lays out the struggles of being oneself in a world full of people trying to conform you to their expectations. 

My own personal experience helps me understand this statement, especially in my teenage years. With the stress of school and navigating social relationships, I found myself trying to fit into what everyone else expected of me. But I quickly learned that nothing was worth compromising my own individual values and desires for. By making decisions that reflected my own individualistic preferences, I gained a sense of peace and self-confidence. 

Ultimately, it is important to stay true to oneself in spite of the world around them. While it can be difficult, it is essential if we want to enjoy a meaningful, fulfilling journey through life. Knowing who we are and standing up for our individualistic values will allow us to achieve the greatest possible amount of personal satisfaction. ",AI

Online classes offer many advantages to taking traditional classes in a physical school building. One major positive of taking online classes is that you can attend them from anywhere in the world. You don’t need to physically be in the same place as your instructor to get help or to learn. Additionally, with online classes, you have the ability to reach out for help at any time and you can pause or rewind lessons if needed. Taking an online class also leaves you with more time to focus on other activities that may not be related to study. 

On the other hand, attending a physical school offers the ability to interact with a group of peers and the instructor in a way that is not possible in an online environment. In this environment, you have the opportunity to build close relationships with teachers and classmates by having face-to-face conversations, growing together through discussions, and participating in interesting activities. Additionally, attending a physical school allows for in-person help so you can get direct feedback from teachers if you are having difficulty understanding something. As a result, attending a physical school allows for fostering long-term relationships that can benefit a student’s learning experience. 

Though each option has its own advantages, it's important to take these factors into consideration when deciding between taking online classes or attending a physical school.",AI

Failure is a common occurrence and one that everyone must learn to accept. While there is a risk associated with failure, it is important for people to understand that they can find a way to turn failure into success. One way to do this is to stay motivated and focus on the positive aspects of the situation. People should focus on the growth that is achieved by learning from their mistakes and discovering creative solutions to the challenges they face.

In recent years, more and more young people are choosing to commit to a career at a very young age. Examples of successful people who committed to a career at a young age can be seen in individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, who at the age of 19 founded the social networking site, Facebook. While committing to a career at a young age can have a positive impact, it is important to understand that not everyone is suited for committing to a career at such a young age. Further, there are examples of those who have decided to slow down their career pursuits and wait until later in life, achieving success in a different manner. 

Ultimately, commitment to a career and deciding to follow a certain path is an individual choice and should be based on trust in one's own abilities. Those who commit to a career at a young age tend to have opportunities to gain experience and are able to focus more clearly on their career goals. Trust in the process and in yourself can lead to career success, regardless of when you decide to commit to your chosen profession. Ultimately, it is important to understand that making a decisions on when to commit to a career is personal and should be made with thoughtful consideration and research.",AI

On the one hand, the motivation that comes with the dedication to completing homework in a supportive academic environment could significantly improve student grades and attendance. Improved academic performance could also lead to increased self-confidence in students, which could be beneficial in other aspects of their lives.

Committing to a career at a young age has many advantages. For one, those who are younger often have the capacity to learn faster, meaning that they can get ahead with their career preparations sooner. The mental and knowledge preparation that is a part of committing to a career at a young age is also one of its benefits, as they will have the time to explore different career options and become properly informed of what the job will entail. On the other hand, students who don't want to commit to choosing a career at a young age may find themselves with a disadvantage later on; without having the time to find out what career they would ideally like, they may find themselves accepting jobs they don't want out of desperation. By committing to a career at a young age, students can ensure that they get the most out of their education and embark on the career path they have chosen with confidence.",AI

Students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, provided they are used only during lunch, recess, or any other designated time outside of class. By having phones available, students can keep in touch with their parents, say if they need a ride home, or in case of an emergency.

In order to avoid distraction from student phones, teachers should set clear expectations for when and how students are allowed to use their phones. For instance, phones may only be used during breaks or lunchtime only and must remain off and away from sight during class. Teachers should also enforce consequences if rules are broken, such as temporary removal of the device.

On the other hand, students need to take responsibility for their own phones. It should go without saying that they should abide by school policies and not use their phones during class. Also, if there is a policy in place to keep phones away from sight during class, phones should not be used at any time in the hallway, classroom, or any other public area until students are out of class. Students should also be aware that if they are found to be breaking these policies, their phones can be taken away by teachers.

All in all, students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, provided they are used responsibly and only during the times designated by the school. With clear expectations and penalties in place, students and teachers can work together to ensure that the phones stay out of classrooms, and that students remain focused and productive during the school day.",AI

Thomas Jefferson was a statesman, inventor, and influential philosopher. He served as the third president of the United States of America and was instrumental in shaping the early years of the nation. His most notable accomplishment was the passage of the Declaration of Independence, which laid out the fundamental principles of freedom and justice that guide our nation today.

Jefferson was a firm believer in the power of education and the importance of improving society through science and technology. His commitment to personal liberty and the free exchange of ideas inspired countless reformers to pursue similar ideals. He famously stated, “It is never too late to form the habits of a good life.” His commitment to this philosophy has been credited with inspiring individuals to strive for greatness and work to make the world a better place.

Jefferson’s beliefs and accomplishments still serve as invaluable lessons for today. He encouraged people to think critically, challenge norms, and strive for progress.

Distance learning can provide students with a valuable educational experience that can be tailored to their individual needs, offering a range of benefits that the traditional classroom setting cannot. One of the key advantages of distance learning is that it frees students from the physical and social pressures that can be found in a classroom setting. Without the traditional classroom environment, students can avoid the peer pressure, judgment, and discouragement that can be experienced in an academic context. In addition, the lack of physical presence can also reduce the potential for cheating, by providing a secure environment where all students have equal access to resources. Furthermore, distance learning offers a scalable form of education that can be easily accessible to students regardless of geographic location, allowing students to continue their studies without worrying about their ability to attend a physical classroom.

After researching the advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day to two hours for a four-day week, it is the recommendation of this report that the school should extend the school day. The extended school day would provide more time for teachers to complete their syllabi and would reduce the amount of student stress due to shortened test-intensive days. Additionally, students who are working would not have to miss classes and would benefit from better time management skills that would come from the four-day school week. However, the extended school day should come with specific guidelines such as an optional lunch period and alternate modes of instruction to ensure that student engagement and educational goals are not sacrificed.",AI

Failure is a valuable learning experience, and an essential part of any journey to success. Without failure, young minds are unable to understand resilience and perseverance.

Making decisions can be challenging, and many of us struggle to decide the right path to take. However, it is important to remember that no matter how certain you might be that your opinion is right, one person's opinion is rarely enough to reach a successful resolution. Taking the input of more than one person and considering multiple angles is an essential part of the decision-making process.

This was something I realized during my sophomore year in college when my professor assigned us a group project. With each member in the group bringing a unique perspective and expertise, we were able to come up with a unique and creative solution to the project that none of us would have thought of alone. Without having all of us involved and working together, the project would have been much less successful.

In addition, it is just as important to take risks. Doing the same thing over and over does not allow you to reach new heights and experience different things. After graduating college, I decided to take a risk and move to a new city, despite having no job prospects there. Although it was a bit of a roller coaster, I quickly learned about the city and grew an appreciation for it while meeting amazing people and making lifelong connections.

It is these risks that are often the biggest rewards. Taking multiple opinions into account and having the courage to take a leap of faith will help you become more confident in your decisions and achieve things you never thought were possible.",AI

Setting a good example is one of the best ways to inspire and positively influence those around us. It can be as simple as exhibiting positive behaviors, such as being kind to others, showing understanding, and exuding a sense of warmth. These traits can inspire others to believe, respect, and trust us. As a result, our good examples can create opportunities for us, provide stability in our surroundings, and help us create a powerful legacy that can last for generations.

One example of how setting a good example can lead to positive outcomes is the story of Malala Yousafzai. Though she was born in a part of the world known for its patriarchal values, she persevered and fought for equal opportunities for girls’ education. She spoke out against the injustice, sparking a movement and becoming a symbol of strength and courage for millions of young girls around the world. 

The late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also serves as an inspiring example of setting a good example. Throughout his long-fought battle against racism and racial injustice, he remained hopeful and peaceful, never resorting to violence in spite of the violence meted out against him and his supporters. He demonstrated to the world that by remaining steadfast in his beliefs and displaying unwavering courage in the face of oppression, he created a legacy of peace and justice.

In conclusion, setting a good example is essential for achieving positive outcomes both for ourselves and those around us. Establishing good behaviors, such as kindness, understanding, and courage, can help us create the legacy of a lifetime and inspire generations.",AI

Motivating a student without the use of praise can be a difficult but important task for educators and parents. Research has shown that giving praise to students has a positive effect on their self-esteem, providing them with a sense of accomplishment and gratification. But on the flip side, there is also evidence that suggests an excessive amount of praise can have a detrimental effect. Giving praise too often can lead students to become dependent on external validation, making them less likely to take initiative and self-motivate if it doesn't come with the promise of a reward. 

For this reason, it is important to recognize when praising actually helps, and when it can be harmful. Encouraging students to strive for personal goals and achievements can encourage them to become independent and self-motivated. While praise may be beneficial in small doses, celebrating successes holistically and emphasizing the journey rather than the result can be just as, if not more, rewarding for a student - and is less likely to have a negative effect.

It is widely accepted that having a positive attitude helps individuals to achieve success. It enables us overcome any obstacles that may stand in our path and push us to our full potential; however, success is not exclusively dependent on having a positive attitude. Even with a positive outlook, success is not always guaranteed. It is important to allow ourselves to feel negative emotions and understand that the fullest potential of success cannot be reached without recognizing our insecurities, doubts, and fears. 

One beneficial strategy to maintain positivity when surrounded by negativity is to take a break and focus on something else that brings us pleasure. Finding simple activities that can be enjoyed in our own time can help to temporarily take our minds away from our worries and stressors. Furthermore, having a positive attitude can help us discover our passions and achieve our personal objectives, as we recognize the opportunities and meaningful objectives that each day has to offer. Finally, being surrounded with positive influences and supportive friends and family can help to reinforce our positive outlook and provide us with the optimism and belief of achieving success.",AI

When making important decisions, it is often essential to seek out the advice of the people who are closest to us. These can range from friends and family to mentors and consultants. Life experience can be a great source of wisdom for important decisions, as it can provide insightful observations and a unique perspective that can help someone to see a problem from a different angle. 

I personally experienced this when I was considering joining the military after graduating high school. Although I had already made up my mind to do so, I still sought out the advice of my father, who had also served. His advice was simple but powerful—to make sure to keep an open mind and think through every angle before making a final decision. He knew the value of carefully weighing the pros and cons of any decision, even one as significant as mine. 

In addition to family, friends are also an invaluable source of advice when making decisions. We often build our closest circles of friends over many years, and they get to know us as well as we know ourselves. Good friends can often be additional eyes and ears on a situation, and can even offer fresh perspectives that would not have otherwise occurred to us. 

Therefore, it is clear that both life experience and guidance from friends and family are essential when making important decisions. Seeking input from trusted advisors can help to confirm or adjust the direction of a decision, leading to a more informed choice. Ultimately, the combination of life experience and wisdom from trusted sources can be invaluable when making decisions.",AI

Online classes can be a useful way for students to receive an education, but they also come with risks that cannot be ignored. Some schools in the United States should not offer online classes for their students because they could easily become a substitute for vital social interaction and can lead to a decrease in the overall quality of learning.

For many students, online classes remove the compelling motivation of being in contact with their teachers and peers. Without this real connection with people, it can become extremely easy for students to neglect their work, skip assignments, and procrastinate more than if they were physically in the classroom. Without this condition of accountability, students are more likely to receive a sub-par education.

Furthermore, it is impossible to replicate the real-world experience from a computer. By exclusively taking online classes, students miss out on learning skills such as public speaking, participating in group activities, and working collectively with peers. Social interaction is a crucial part of learning, as well as a student's development. If students are used to exclusively taking classes online, it poses the risk of further isolating them from the world. 

In conclusion, the potential risks that come with online classes are not worth the convenience. Schools in the United States should not offer online classes if it means compromising the quality of education and decreasing social interaction for their students.",AI

Self-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. 

In real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. 

The same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. 

The thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act. 

In conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. Ultimately, self-reliance is the key to personal growth and success.",AI

Education is a fundamental part of life. It can be a chore or a pleasant experience, depending on how activities are implemented. When done right, activities can be enjoyable and educational simultaneously. This essay will explore the concept of education activities that are both enjoyable and educational by looking at examples from science experiments, sports activities, and playing instruments.

Science experiments are an often overlooked source of educational activities that can be enjoyable. For younger students, easy experiments such as growing plants, producing audio waves, or exploring the natural world with a microscope can provide hours of enjoyable education. Not only does this give children an opportunity to use their bodies, minds, and senses, but it also helps engage their curiosity, problem-solving skills, and ability to think critically.

Sports activities are also an excellent way to make learning enjoyable. Team sports, races, and competitions can bring out the best of children, who are looking for a chance to learn and grow at the same time. It can be as simple as playing a game of tag, where the children have to use their knowledge of math and geometry, or using a basketball court to illustrate the basics of angles and trajectories. This can be an incredibly effective way to make learning fun and memorable.

Finally, playing musical instruments can be both enjoyable and educational. This can include learning to play a guitar, singing along with a choir, or mastering the drums. These activities require the use of key listening, coordination, and analytical skills, while also allowing the student to explore music theory, composition, and history. This type of activity can also foster a sense of accomplishment and pride in the student, making it an enjoyable educational experience.

In conclusion, educational activities can be both enjoyable and educational when done right. Through using examples from science experiments, sports activities, and playing instruments, we have seen how educational activities can engage children on multiple levels, while also providing an avenue for personal growth and satisfaction. As such, educational activities should be seen as an ideal way to foster long lasting learning that can be both enjoyable and educational.",AI

Being active and having an active lifestyle can have many benefits and drawbacks. One benefit of staying active is that it can help improve one's overall physical health, as it can aid in decreasing a variety of disease risks such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Staying active can also help one's mental health, as studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce levels of stress and depression. Additionally, staying active can help maintain a healthy weight, and can even help one to look and feel better. 

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to living an active lifestyle. Exercising and participating in physical activities can place physical strain and stress on the body, which can lead to aches, pains, and injuries if one is not careful. Additionally, not all forms of exercise are equal, and certain activities can involve more risk than others. Furthermore, staying active requires motivation and dedication, which can be tough for some people to find.

Cellphones in the classroom can have a marked effect on student success, both positive and negative. Although having a tool for information available can be beneficial, it can also be a distraction from the important task at hand—learning and engaging in academic pursuits. 

Three key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom are decreased attention to the teacher, inappropriate usage for non-educational purposes, and disruption of the classroom environment. Not listening to the teacher eliminates the opportunity to learn and participate in a meaningful way, leading to decreased academic success. Additionally, if students are using their phone for non-educational purposes, such as playing games or sending messages, this takes away from focus on educational tasks. Finally, when the classroom environment is consistently disrupted by the noise and visual distraction that accompanying cellphone use, the learning experience is compromised.

Long summer breaks for students have several potential benefits for their educational development. For one, students can have the opportunity to stay engaged in educational activities, such as reading or attending summer school, which can help maximize learning outcomes and boost academic success. Even more, longer summer breaks can give students the opportunity to explore and participate in extra-curricular endeavors, such as internships or job shadowing opportunities, which can help them find a career path they are interested in or gain valuable job skills. 

On the other hand, short summer breaks can also provide benefits for students’ educational development. For example, classroom environments are structured to provide students with a consistent and secure learning atmosphere — something which they may not have access to over a long summer break. Furthermore, short summer breaks reduce the amount of disruptive absences; this allows students to maintain the same peer group over the course of the academic year, providing them with a sense of accessibility as well as the ability to form relationships with their peers, teachers, and school faculty.

One of the most influential quotes of all time, Thomas Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle"". To this day, it remains a timeless piece of advice for those looking to make the most of their life.

It is often argued that schools should make students join extra-curricular activities, but this can have a damaging effect on students. Making students join extracurricular activities increases homework burdens and leads to a heightened level of fatigue and stress. 

When students are asked to join a club or participate in certain activities, it can impede their ability to focus on their schoolwork. This, in turn, can lead to increased amounts of homework and less time to do it in. This ultimately leaves them with less time to spend on their academic courses and can lead to substandard work. 

In addition to the increased homework, students may also experience increased levels of fatigue and stress. Trying to balance an extra-curricular activity with their usual course of study can be taxing and puts students under tremendous stress. This can lead to poorer academic results, as well as mental and physical health issues. 

With all these factors in mind, principals should not make students join extra-curricular activities. The increased strain on a student’s academic schedule and the strain of anxiety and fatigue can negatively affect a student’s education.

Students should not be forced to consume healthy food in the school lunch system. The need to consume fresh fruits and vegetables, or balanced and nutritious meals cannot be overemphasized; however, it should not be mandated in the school lunch system, since it takes away the students’ right to choose their own food. 

When students are forced to eat healthy food, there is no guarantee that the meals are as nutritious and beneficial to their health as parents or authorities tend to believe. Children may not like the mandated food, which may result in them feeling deprived. Healthy food tend to have less flavour and appeal than the junk food that students usually prefer. Forced consumption of healthy options will have a negative impact on a student’s enjoyment of food and there is a risk of discouragement of a genuine interest to try and explore healthy foods. 

Furthermore, healthy food is often more expensive than junk food. The government should take this into account and not enact policies that are likely to cause financial problems for families that may not be able to afford the more expensive, more nutritious food. 

In conclusion, mandating a healthy lunch system in schools is not a good idea. Students should be encouraged and informed on the benefits of healthy eating, but ultimately be left to make their own choices.",AI

Having a positive attitude in life is incredibly significant to personal success. Having a positive attitude can help individuals to take on obstacles with enthusiasm and resilience. In the workplace, having a positive attitude can help to motivate, innovate, problem-solve, and lift the spirits of colleagues. A positive attitude is also especially beneficial during “times of need”, when one must face personal life crises with courage. A negative attitude can prevent one from prospering, as it can give rise to feelings of doubt, insecurity, and helplessness. Remaining optimistic and maintaining a positive outlook in “times of need” is essential for one’s emotional well-being and capacity to persevere. Ultimately, having a positive attitude leads to personal success, self-confidence, and a willingness to take risks, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking growth and progress in life.",AI

Graduating high school in four or three years has potential advantages and drawbacks that must be considered when making the decision to pursue the shortened schedule. Summer classes are an option for those looking to graduate early, but it is important to weigh the reasons one might not want to take courses during the summer, such as exhaustion from taking classes during the school year or wanting to pursue other interests such as a job or a summer internship. 

Elective classes are a great way to round out a high school educational experience. Electives may include art, music, foreign language, and other courses not typically part of the traditional curriculum. These classes may have an advantage in terms of helping a student stand out in the college application process. 

Additional factors influencing student decisions include working to save money for college and the cost of supplies such as textbooks. Graduating high school early could ease the financial burden, but the amount of coursework students may miss could have a negative impact on their college readiness. Ultimately, students must consider potential financial, time, and educational implications when determining how valuable an early graduation timeline will be for their academic future.",AI

Group collaboration can offer a number of benefits both academically and socially. In terms of academics, working in groups promotes the sharing of ideas and resources, which can improve the quality of the work being done and reduce the overall burden of tasks. For example, a group of students working on a school project can divide the work into manageable amounts, with each member of the group having their own task and accountability for its completion. By doing this, the overall project can be completed much more efficiently than if each student was working on their own.

Socially, working in groups can allow for the development of relationships and networking opportunities. Students can form relationships with their peers and learn how to work effectively as a team. These skills can prove to be invaluable both in and out of the classroom, as they can improve interactions, communication, and teamwork abilities in other aspects of life.

Though working in groups can offer these benefits, it can also pose potential challenges. Not every group member is capable of putting in an equal amount of effort, and a lack of respect for one another’s contributions can lead to inefficiencies or delays in completing the projects. To overcome this, group members should be mindful of giving each other space and voice, and be open to productive feedback and compromise. Additionally, establishing clear expectations, goals, and deadlines for the project, and assigning clear roles to each group member, can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that all tasks are completed on time. 

In conclusion, working in groups can offer both academic and social benefits, but challenges can arise if adequate measures are not taken to ensure everyone is working together efficiently and respectfully. By fostering communication and understanding within the group, and by establishing expectations and roles, the members of a group can work together effectively to complete a project with the best possible results.",AI

Having a professional career is essential to living a successful and meaningful life. Most importantly, it can bring happiness not only to the individual but to the family as well. In order for this to happen, students must take full responsibility for their professional journey. It is important that students pay close attention to what they’re doing and take all the necessary steps to pursue their professional aspirations.

However, it is not enough to merely pursue and secure a professional career. Students should also stay aware of the risks associated with neglecting their responsibilities. A professional career is one of the highest forms of responsibility and can come with a tremendous amount of pressure. If a student fails to meet their obligations, whether due to lack of knowledge or a simple lack of dedication, it can lead to severe repercussions.

Overall, a professional career is on the utmost importance and comes with its own set of unique responsibilities. Students must remain fully aware of their personal goals and take ownership of their career in order to guarantee success and a happy future, both for themselves and their families. Only through diligence and hard work can a student truly realize their full potential and reach their highest aspirations.",AI

Having a positive attitude is essential to success in many aspects of life, including school, relationships, and dealing with difficult obstacles in life. Studies have shown that positivity not only helps boost morale and productivity, but can also affect outcomes in the situations mentioned above. For instance, research has shown that students who have a more positive outlook on their academic performance tend to receive higher grades and do better on tests than those with a negative attitude. In relationships, having a positive attitude encourages positive interactions between two people, resulting in better communication and a stronger bond. In addition, when faced with difficult obstacles, those with a positive attitude can better recognize potential solutions and navigate their way to a better outcome. 

Many successful people have achieved their success, in part, from having a positive attitude. For example, Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, is known for his unwavering optimism, which helped him push through the difficult times during Apple’s early years and eventually led to great success. Oprah Winfrey, another inspiring example, credits her abundant success to her decision to never doubt herself and to always think positively. These stories exemplify how having a positive attitude can have a positive impact on one's life in a variety of ways. ",AI

In each of their stories, failure acted as an opportunity to learn and grow, while perseverance enabled them to continue pressing forward on their pathways to success. 

The famous quote by Winston Churchill, 'never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in', is the ultimate proclamation of resilience in the face of failure. It reminds us not to be discouraged in times of adversity and to remain dedicated to our pursuits despite the countless obstacles that may be thrown our way. The stories of these successful individuals serve to illustrate the truth of Churchill's words - that if we stay resilient in the face of failure, great feats may be achieved.",AI

After high school, I was determined to pursue my ambition of becoming a professional dancer. But I quickly realized it wasn't going to be easy to break into that competitive field. There was a fierce competition and not everyone had the talent or the dedication to make it in the industry. So for me, it was a clear choice - hard work and determination was the only way forward.

Imagination and knowledge are both essential components of human life and the development of our societies. Imagination is the power of the human mind to conceive or create images and ideas that are not based on past experience, which makes it a fundamental tool for exploration, innovation and creativity. Knowledge, on the other hand, is the accumulation of facts, information and skills acquired through study, experience or teaching, allowing us to use this knowledge in a practical and meaningful way. 

When we put these two concepts together, they become even more powerful. Imagination can open up the door for knowledge to be used in creative ways, allowing us to develop new theories, solve problems, explore new possibilities and come up with innovative solutions. It is this combination of imagination and knowledge that is essential to learning and development. 

Without imagination, knowledge would become dull and uninspiring as it would lack the freedom of thought needed to truly propel us forward. Imagination allows us to think outside the box, to explore ideas that would otherwise be overlooked, and to find solutions to complex situations. At the same time, knowledge allows us to take our ideas and put them into practice in a tangible form. 

Therefore, the importance of imagination compared to knowledge cannot be underestimated. They are two sides of the same coin; one without the other would not be enough. Together, they offer the perfect balance between theoretical thinking and practical application, allowing for a greater level of understanding and progress.",AI

Taking advice from others can play a pivotal role in shaping life decisions. For one, looking to mentors, parents, or guardians for advice can be immensely beneficial. They have a wealth of knowledge, life experience, and wisdom that can take us far - just look at Abraham Lincoln, and the incredible difference he made by ending slavery, after he'd requested counsel from various members of his cabinet. In the same way, advice can change the course of our lives, much like how trying new foods from different chefs can open our eyes and palates to new culinary delights.

It is not just the potential benefits of advice for life decisions, however. By taking the advice and wisdom of others, and applying it to our day-to-day lives, we can gain a more successful and hardworking mindset.

The key to achieving our goals is to develop patience. As the old saying goes, haste makes waste. If we act too quickly or without proper consideration, we are likely to make mistakes and take the wrong course of action, which can be detrimental in the long run. To prevent this, we should act thoughtfully and patiently to ensure our best efforts are taken towards reaching our goals.

For example, let's consider planning for a successful business venture. If we rush through the process of researching potential investments or launching a product, we may make mistakes that will cost us money in the future. Even something like setting up a website can require patience. We may need to take the time to ensure our web hosting and security are up to scratch in order to guarantee the safety and satisfaction of our customers.

Patience and accuracy are essential to achieving our goals.

Some people argue that it is solely up to an individual to choose their own character traits. They believe that we have the ability to choose traits such as kindness, rudeness, helpfulness, etc. However, I believe that our character is formed by influences beyond our control. 

For example, we often see people around us display certain qualities and behaviors. We may be exposed to these characters day after day, and with enough of this exposure, our own mindset and attitude can begin to shift and adapt. Additionally, there are certain lifestyle habits and environmental circumstances that can have a large influence on who we become. Education, familial relationships, economic status, etc. all play a role in our overall character. 

Similarly, genetics are also a huge factor in our overall character development. Our values, thought processes, and communication patterns can all be linked to our genetic makeup. This can be seen in the many cases of people who grew up in very different environments, and yet have similar behavioral traits and characteristics. 

In conclusion, while we may be able to choose certain character traits, it is important to remember that our character is much more complex than that. Many outside influences play a role in the development of our character. Embracing this understanding of character development can help us appreciate the complexities of our personality and the various factors that come together to shape who we are.",AI

Failure is an inevitable part of life that most experience in some way. But does failure need to be present in order for all of us to enjoy success? Some people might argue that it does, but I disagree. I believe that failure is not necessary to have success, and that it can have a negative effect on enthusiasm.

Many of us perceive failure as a necessary part of the journey of life towards success. Failure teaches us lessons and sometimes strengthens our determination. However, for many of us, failure can be a crushing blow that completely destroys our enthusiasm. Depending on the individual, failure can cause us to give up and become discouraged. It can make us feel unworthy or incapable of achieving future goals, which can harm the state of our enthusiasm. With this in mind, I argue that failure does not necessarily have to be present to have success; rather, it can stunt our enthusiasm and thus prevent us from achieving success.

To illustrate this point, I will refer to my own personal experiences. A few years ago, after failing the same test over and over, I felt completely discouraged and ready to give up. I thought that because I failed at one task, I was incapable of achieving all my other goals. This brought my enthusiasm to a complete standstill, and I felt ready to throw in the towel. At this moment, I realized that failure doesn’t have to be present in order to succeed. Instead, I understood that my attitude towards failure was what had to change. By being more aware of my expectations and being confident in myself, I was able to push forward and find success despite the failures I had faced in the past.

In conclusion, failure is not necessary to have success, and it can have a debilitating effect on enthusiasm. Despite the life lessons that failure can teach us, it can also be detrimental to our well-being when we become too fixated on it. I urge us all to remember that success does not have to be preceded by failure, and to be more confident and accepting of ourselves after setbacks. That way, we can have a much better chance of achieving success.",AI

The debate of public school vs. distance learning has been a long standing argument. On one hand, public school provides students the opportunity to experience social interactions and peer relationships that will benefit them in the long run. However, with the current pandemic, distance learning has become a necessity. For those considering distance learning, it is important to consider the pros and cons to ensure that it is the right fit for their situation. 

One of the key advantages of distance learning is that it is more convenient and can be schedule to fit a variety of needs. Students can also access materials and resources online that would otherwise be difficult in a traditional setting. Furthermore, it allows students to customize their learning by working independently and taking charge of their own progress. 

However, it is important to note that distance learning also has its drawbacks. The lack of social interaction can lead to feelings of isolation, while also making it easier to cheat as there isn’t the same level of accountability as there would be in a traditional classroom setting. Furthermore, it requires students to be self-motivated and have good time-management skills in order to successfully complete their work. 

In conclusion, the decision to choose public school or distance learning should be based on individual needs and preferences. Distance learning can be an excellent option for those who need extra flexibility or convenience but it requires students to be dedicated and motivated in order to succeed.",AI

Additionally, providing rewards, such as recognition or fun activities like game or movie nights, can also encourage learning and help students stay motivated. 

Finally, providing the right kind of support is necessary. Having an adult facilitator available to answer questions and provide guidance can help students develop the needed skills to complete their work. Additionally, forming small study groups or creating a mentorship program can help foster a sense of community and help students build relationships with their peers.

Creating an after-school homework club at our school could be a great way to help students succeed. Research demonstrates that students who have extra support with their homework can improve their academic performance over the long-term. While there are potential challenges to creating and running such a club, potential solutions exist. 

One challenge is finding a way to recruit and introduce students to the club. Students need to be made aware of the club and its agenda, and also understand that it is a safe and supportive environment. We could use word of mouth, as well as flyers, email, and other methods of advertisement.

Another issue is keeping the club going. Any program requires long-term commitment and a vision for the future. We could maintain and increase interest and commitment with regular meetings, competitions, and rewards. Having a broad and engaging agenda would help to keep students motivated.

Finally, an important challenge is finding resources and help for running the club. We could seek help from teachers and administrators, as well as community organizations and businesses that may be willing to contribute resources.

Creating an after-school homework club not only offers students the support and guidance they need for their long-term academic success, but it can also have a significant impact on our school's overall performance. If students are able to improve their skills as a result of involvement in the club, this can result in higher test scores, improved grades, and ultimately increase our school's reputation.

When it comes to setting curfews for teenagers, it is a difficult and oftentimes divisive decision between parents, children and society. On the one hand, setting a 10PM Weekday and Midnight curfew for teenagers instills a sense of responsibility and safety. It sends the message that young people should be careful about the choices they make and that staying out too late can put them at risk. Furthermore, it can provide structure and ensure that teens are completing their educational and extracurricular activities, and getting enough sleep to remain healthy and alert for the next day. 

On the other hand, setting such a restriction on teenagers could appear to be an attempt to prevent them from exploring the world and engaging in age-appropriate activities — such as group events, movies, or other extracurricular activities — and instead keeps them at home in a supervised environment. Moreover, it could teach young people that their parents don’t fully trust them to make the right decisions and that they should not be expected to be in control of their own lives.

Modern students often debate the merits of classes in the arts being required versus being elective. While some argue that classes in the arts should not be required, as they do not provide students with practical skills for future employment, others maintain that the arts can provide academic and personal growth, expanding students' worldviews. 

From my own experience, taking classes in the arts has provided me with a better appreciation for the creative process and non linear modes of thinking. It has also developed my skills in collaboration, as much of the artistic process can be a shared effort.

Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"". This quote captures the truth that failure and enthusiasm are both integral parts of the pursuit of success. Life is filled with challenges and difficult moments, and the courage to face them and the enthusiasm to drive towards our ambitions helps us to reach our goals.

Failure can often be an unpleasant experience, and it can be difficult to keep our enthusiasm when failure happens. We must remember, however, that failure is often part of the journey in the pursuit of success. Failure teaches us valuable lessons that can help us to become better equipped to reach our goals. By pressing on even in the face of failure, we gain insight into what works and what doesn't, enabling us to arrive at successes that may not have been achievable had we given up in the face of adversity.

Enthusiasm is also essential to the pursuit of success. It helps to keep us motivated and inspired, and when coupled with courage, it can be a powerful tool in overcoming the challenges we inevitably encounter on our journeys. If we possess an unshakeable enthusiasm, we can stay focused on our goals and make significant strides in achieving them.

Both failure and enthusiasm are essential part of a successful life. We must learn to embrace failure as part of the journey and to keep our enthusiasm alive despite challenges and setbacks. Winston Churchill's quote is a reminder of this important truth, and should inspire us to face obstacles with courage, and to stay committed to our ambitions with enthusiasm.",AI

Winter is an incredibly important and popular time for breaks as it has historically been the favorite of students, parents, and teachers alike. However, the past few years have seen an increase in extreme and often dangerous snow storms, which has led some to consider a longer winter break, but at the expense of shorter summer and one-week fall and spring breaks. While the idea of a longer winter break does have some advantages, the negative consequences could be significant.

The first major advantage to having a longer winter break would be the extra time students get to spend with their families and friends, creating happy memories of the holidays. Unfortunately, the problems this could cause greatly outweigh the benefits. With a longer winter break, students will miss out on vital instructional time that is crucial for their mental and social development. If this type of break were to be widespread, it could lead to significant gaps in students’ education, which could negatively affect their academic performance. A longer winter break may also have a detrimental effect on the overall economy. Experts have found that longer breaks can discourage spending by students and their families, impacting businesses that rely on the additional income during this time.

In light of these considerations, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are a better idea. Regular breaks give students the opportunity to learn, participate in recreational activities, and create long-lasting memories during these times. They provide the perfect balance between academic development and leisure activities so students can go back to school feeling energized and ready to start a new semester. Regular winter breaks also keep students out of frigid conditions and instead allows them to enjoy the comforts of home in a safe and secure environment. As a result, regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are the best option for students, their families, and the overall economy.",AI

Graduating early can be a very beneficial way to further a student's education or career, but there are some potential risks that should be considered. On the positive side, graduating early can allow a student to jump ahead in their college or job career. It may enable them to start their career earlier, or even give them the opportunity to pursue further education or specialized courses.

The drawbacks, however, can be significant. Early graduates may not be as prepared as their peers for the next step in their career or education. They may lack the polish and be behind in certain skills needed for the next journey. They would also miss out on the networking, connections, and experiences that would help them further their education or career.

In conclusion, graduating early can be a great way to benefit a student's education and career prospects. However, potential risks and drawbacks must be weighed against the potential advantages to make an informed decision.",AI

It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the trials and tribulations that life throws our way. However, something that we should never forget is the value of a single act of kindness. In the face of difficulty, an act of kindness, no matter how small, can provide some light in the darkness. Even in the toughest of times, small acts of kindness like a smile, lending a hand to a friend in need, or simply being a good listener can be enough to hold onto hope and stay positive. 

When faced with adversity, it can be easy to forget that even the smallest acts of kindness are enough to make a difference. Kindness can help us to appreciate the little moments that make life special. The dawn of a new day, a cool breeze on a summer evening, or the beauty of a sunset can all be enjoyed by reaching out and extending a kind gesture to someone who might be struggling. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to experience a moment of joy and relief.

We are all connected, and kindness has an infinite ripple effect. Kindness isn’t meant to be measured—it’s meant to be shared. As such, no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. Whether it’s a gesture of tenderness, compassion, or simply a listening ear, kindness is a healing balm to the soul. It has the power to lift us up, keep us positive, and most importantly, seize the day no matter the circumstances.",AI

Self-reliance is an important tool for making decisions and feeling secure in them. When we rely on ourselves for decision making, we take full ownership of the choices we make. This act of self-determination helps us feel confident in the decisions we make, no matter what the outcome. Additionally, self-reliance encourages us to prioritize what matters most in life, so we can focus our time and effort on what really matters. By allowing ourselves to take responsibility over our lives, we can better identify what is truly meaningful and valuable in life, and make decisions that align with our core values.",AI

Working with a group has several distinct advantages. Group members can help to share the workload, bring different skill sets and perspectives to the project, and may even offer encouragement and support. On the other hand, working alone has its own advantages as well, as it allows for quicker decision making, fewer delays, and complete autonomy over the project. 

However, a group experience also carries some distinct disadvantages. Projects can be complicated by conflicting opinions and ideas, communication issues, and the challenge of managing a cohesive team. In contrast, working alone carries the risk of project stagnation, limited resources, and a greater challenge in staying motivated.

Overall, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the project and the team. Working with a group may be a better fit when tackling a complicated project, while a small project may be best suited for working alone. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the project goals and the individuals involved.",AI

Technology has drastically changed the way we communicate and shop, for better or for worse. Social media and video conferencing have made it possible for people all over the world to communicate with ease, allowing us to build long-distance relationships and engage in virtual conversations. On the other hand, online marketplaces and apps have made it incredibly easy to purchase goods from the comfort of our own homes, meaning we may be missing out on the joys of the traditional in-person shopping experience. 

The role of technology in schools has been a subject of debate for many years. While there is no denying that technology has made education more accessible to students, the decrease in in-person interaction has led to a disconnect between teachers and students, resulting in a level of academic disengagement never seen before. 

Moreover, people have become increasingly dependent on technology in recent years. From search engines to AI-powered robots, technology is everywhere we turn and is even used to make life decisions, such as what kind of healthcare or the best school for our children. This high reliance on technology can result in people being over-dependent, making it difficult for them to function without it. 

Without technology, the world we live in today would be dramatically different. Most communication would be done through written letters, goods would have to be purchased from physical stores, and access to education would be limited, among many other changes. Technology has undeniably shaped our lives and while it can be both a blessing and a curse, it is here to stay.",AI

Technology has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, and its impact on physical and mental health, communication in relationships, and the benefits of in-person interaction is undeniable. Recent research has shown that increased technology usage can create feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety, leading to physical issues such as sleep deprivation, muscle aches, and headaches. The role of technology in communication in relationships can also be significant. While it can facilitate communication and stay in touch with faraway loved ones, its use can also facilitate a superficial connection with problems that can manifest in the long term. Additionally, in-person interactions provide a profoundly different experience than doing most activities online. Interacting with someone in person provides an emotional and sensory connection that can’t be replicated with technology, such as meeting with a friend to discuss a problem, or purchasing an item in a store and being able to physically inspect it. However, it’s important to exercise caution and restraint when relying on technology. Too much reliance on technology can create a disconnect between people and their physical environment, leading to decreased empathy and social skills, less physical activity, and greater disconnection with the real world.",AI

Staying actively engaged and participating in activities has been linked to many positive results, ranging from physical health benefits to improved mental wellbeing. Active lifestyles, in comparison to idle lifestyles, offer numerous advantages that encourage physical, mental, and emotional growth. In a workplace setting, those who demonstrate a willingness to contribute are seen as motivated and committed to their work, providing an example to colleagues and potentially resulting in rewards and recognition. 

There are a number of notable cases of individuals whose lives have been improved by actively engaging in activities. These positive outcomes are often more tangible than those that come with idleness. If a person fails to stay motivated and productive, they risk remaining stagnant in their personal progress and achievements. Therefore, it is imperative for people to strive to stay engaged in activities that shape and inform their lives, allowing them to grow in a meaningful way.",AI

Technology has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, impacting us both positively and negatively. On the one hand, the increased use of technology has diminished the amount of face-to-face contact, leading to heightened levels of isolation and loneliness among many people. On the other hand, technology has allowed us to accomplish tasks more efficiently and widened our access to information and resources. 

One area in which technology is seen as especially beneficial is in helping older people to manage their medical needs. Technology has enabled advancements that allow seniors to monitor their health and access medical assistance remotely while also connecting them to family members or caregivers. 

Students also reap the rewards of technology, as increased access to computers and the internet means they can access information and resources more easily than ever before. This also allows them to communicate with their peers and teachers more effectively than in the past. 

Lastly, prolonged use of technology does come with some drawbacks. Overuse of electronics can be damaging to a person's physical and mental health, leading to eyestrain, headaches, and poor posture. Additionally, too much screen time can have a detrimental effect on social and emotional development. 

In conclusion, while technology has both positive and negative impacts on our lives, it is ultimately up to us to limit the less beneficial aspects of it and take advantage of the useful ones.",AI

In the past, many individuals have had a lasting and positive impact on society. For example, Susan B. Anthony, a prominent leader in the 19th century women's rights movement, was instrumental in the passage of the 19th Amendment, allowing women to vote in the U.S. This changed the way society views women and set an important precedent for other advancements in the rights of women in the following decades. 

Compare this to today's accomplishments, which are more diverse and numerous. We have seen a trend of advocacy in the rights of minorities, women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people, as well as an increase in social movements such as the Black Lives Matter and Me Too. We've come a long way since Susan B. Anthony's time, but the inactivity of past generations still heavily affects the society of today. 

If prior generations had paid attention to the injustices that still plague our world today and had created more tangible reforms, the present would look very different. Going forward, it is up to us to shape a better future for the generations to come. We must focus on creating better policies and regulations to ensure that everyone is able to live a fair and equitable life. We must use the lessons of the past to move forward and create lasting positive change in our society.",AI

Committing to a career at a young age can offer its own set of unique benefits and challenges. Academically, young people may have the opportunity to specialize in their field of choice early on in their learning journey. This can help give them a distinct advantage when they enter the workforce. Financially, young individuals may be able to start earning money and accumulating wealth earlier, depending on their level of education and experience. On a personal level, it can provide focus and structure in a person's life at a young age and can help steer them towards a fulfilling career.

However, there can be some downsides to committing to a career too early, such as missing out on the valuable time of exploration that many teens enjoy. Furthermore, there is a greater risk of changing industries or jobs later on if a career doesn't work out as planned. Finally, teens may not yet possess the knowledge and experience they need to excel in a professional setting.

It is often said that attitude is everything, and this is especially true when it comes to success in life. Positive thinking has been proven time and time again to be a key component of achieving both short-term and long-term successes, from more mundane everyday accomplishments to reaching our biggest dreams. Positive thinking is the practice of choosing to focus on the good rather than the bad in any situation and thereby engage with life more positively and productively.

When we choose to focus on the good in a situation, our stress and anxiety levels tend to decrease. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.

Furthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Knowing that we can take on challenges, that we can push our limits and still come out on top, is a powerfuliumph of positivityhedge courage in our own capabilities and can be hugely motivational. Striving for success is so much easier when we’re not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.

Making your own decisions and doing things that you enjoy in life are the keys to creating the greatest successes. The world will always tell you what to do and who to be, and though it might seem easier to succumb to those pressures, it is important to remember that it is not the right way to achieve success. When we are given opportunities to make our own decisions and pursue what we find interesting or fulfilling, we open up many new doors that the world can't offer. This allows us to develop our skills and gain unique experiences that can ultimately lead to a much greater success than simply following what someone else says. 

Taking the time to make our own decisions can also help to solidify our sense of identity. It can be easy to begin following what the world wants us to be, but this is in direct opposition to finding out who we are and who we want to be. We can only truly be successful when we are being true to ourselves and embracing our individual strengths. We can accomplish so much more when our decisions and pursuits are in line with who we are as people, instead of trying to fit a mold that someone else has created. 

Making our own decisions and doing things that we enjoy in life can lead to greater successes than simply following what the world wants us to be. This is why it is so important to take the time to pursue our own individual paths and discover what truly brings us joy.",AI

Working in groups could be both beneficial and productive for both the students and the teachers. Groups can make it easier for college students to learn and comprehend difficult material, because they can collaborate on ideas, provide different solutions, and work together to come up with the best answer. Groups also provide a safe space where students can ask questions without feeling embarrassed or intimidated. For teachers, groups can be a great way to keep the students engaged - it encourages students to participate in the lesson and become part of the process, rather than passively listening to a lecture.

Using group work also allows for different teaching styles and methods to be used by the teacher, like simulations, group games, and problem-solving activities. These activities can help to give students an in-depth understanding of the content by providing a more hands-on approach that encourages critical thinking. Working in groups can also give teachers more time to help individual students with their unique needs, as the other students in the group are doing the work.

In conclusion, working in groups in the classroom can be a productive and beneficial experience for both the students and the teachers. The different activities and collaborative work in groups can help students to better understand the material, while the different teaching methods used can engage the students and make the learning process more enjoyable.",AI

Studies have shown that in the United States, students from kindergarten to twelfth grade have received systematic instruction of less than 10 months a year with short summer vacations in between. Long summer breaks are often seen in other countries, with some countries dedicating up to 11 months of consecutive instruction. Although reducing summer break could provide students with more of an opportunity for class instruction, it is important to weigh the negatives that come with it. Not only can these longer school years disrupt the plans and goals of the students, but it can also affect family dynamics when parents are unable to take a substantial break from employment responsibilities. 

When considering the pros and cons of a 10-month school year, it is best to look at the harmful and helpful advantages to students. A longer break provides much-needed restoration and respite for students and lets them take control of their dreams. Yet a longer school year can also be detrimental to students' mental and physical health due to the lack of adequate rest and breaks throughout the year. 

Therefore, when considering these factors, it is important for school systems to take into account the student’s dreams and life aspirations. Changes and modifications need to be made in order to ensure the wellbeing of the students. This includes giving them enough space to pursue their personal interests while also maintaining their studies.",AI

The current educational climate has enabled students to attend classes from home more and more. This shift brings with it both benefits to students as well as drawbacks that could hinder their education. While attending classes from home undoubtedly brings convenience in terms of scheduling and accessibility, it also has consequences on a student's ability to stay focused and remain engaged in school.

One of the biggest benefits of students attending classes from home is the flexibility it gives both students and their families. Studies show that having flexible learning options can result in students better managing their own schedules and being able to take care of other responsibilities while still attending class. This is especially beneficial for students who may have family or work obligations that need to be balanced alongside their schooling.

One of the drawbacks of students attending classes from home is that it can make it difficult for students to stay engaged and connected with the material they're learning. Without the presence of a teacher or classmates, students can struggle to focus on their assignments and have a more difficult time retaining information. To combat this issue, educational systems should emphasize more interaction and communication within their classes. For example, students could be encouraged to have weekly online discussions with their peers or partake in interactive video tutorials and activities that keep them engaged in the material.

In conclusion, while students attending classes from home offers convenience and flexibility, more will need to be done to ensure student engagement and maintain educational standards. This can also enable students to become more self-directed in their studies, allowing them to better manage their obligations and still stay on top of their schooling.",AI

It is essential to never give up and stay enthusiastic despite whatever struggles may occur. These qualities can help anyone achieve anything, even those individuals who may have felt that their ultimate goals and dreams were impossible. For example, if an individual can focus on learning each failure, then develop a method or strategy to attain success, he/she can conquer any challenge that they might encounter. As long as a person stays focused and focused on their own enthusiasm, they will continue to try and have an optimistic outcome.

Michael Jordan’s story is a great demonstration of how success can still be achieved despite failure.

   Technology has rapidly become a vital part of our everyday lives. From keeping us connected to loved ones with smartphones to assisting doctors with diagnosing illnesses, technology has revolutionized the way we live. However, these advancements have not come without potential drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore both the good and bad effects technology has had on individuals and society alike.

On an individual level, technology has made life much simpler. We no longer need to leave our homes to pay bills or shop for groceries, as we can easily do it all online. We can keep all our important documents and photos in the cloud, meaning we don’t have to worry about losing them if our hard drive decides to crash. It has also made communication much easier, as we can now easily keep in contact with people all over the world via video chat or instant messaging services.

However, too much reliance on technology can lead to various problems. People can become isolated if they spend too much time on their digital devices, leading to problems with communication. Also, since many people are now using technology to pay bills, it can be easier to overspend, as we no longer have the physical reminder of cash being taken out of our wallets.

When it comes to society, technology has done a lot of good. The internet has enabled people to access previously unavailable information, meaning they are more informed and can make better decisions. It has also created opportunities, such as telecommuting jobs, that allow people to make a living without having to leave their homes.

However, technology has also had its share of drawbacks. It has contributed to the rise of cybercrime, as malicious actors can now easily target people online. It has also caused several privacy issues, with people’s personal information being shared with companies without their knowledge.

Being yourself may not always be the most natural or easy approach in life, and many of us go out of our way to try and be someone we are not in order to fit in or make others happy. However, embracing the idea of not being yourself and departing from expectations and obligations can often be an accomplishment. After all, it takes courage and an independent mindset to make decisions for yourself and go against the grain of what is expected.

Take for example the classic story of a person from a conservative family, who may be expected to pursue a certain career or study specific subjects, but harbors a passion for something completely different. To go against expectations and pursue the path you really want to be on is a brave choice to make, but it is also necessary for a fulfilling life. Being flexible and adaptable to new opportunities and experiences can open up our lives to unimaginable possibilities that could not have been forecasted. 

One thing to remember is that while it is important to be yourself and be independent, it is equally important to still be mindful of rules and regulations. There are always consequences, both positive and negative, to following or not following rules. Making decisions that respect authority can be an integral part of success, in many areas of life, and following the rules may provide a much-needed structure or sense of security.

The idea of a four-day school week is becoming increasingly popular among school districts nationwide. The concept holds promise, as districts would be able to save money on transportation and other expenses. However, the effects on students must be taken into consideration as well.

On the positive side, students may benefit from having three-day weekends on a regular basis, resulting in higher attendance and engagement. For working parents, a four-day workweek could also provide a reliable childcare option. In addition, research has shown that students learn more effectively with more frequent breaks in their instruction, and that shorter days can be better at improving overall student achievement.

On the other hand, there are potential drawbacks to a four-day school week. For example, it might be difficult for students and staff to adjust to such a drastic change in their daily routine. There is also the concern that students may fall behind in their studies due to the longer days on the fourth day of the week. Additionally, if schools switch to this model, they could face challenges in scheduling after-school activities and providing resources for students who need extra help.

Knowing someone else's challenges and their solutions ahead of time can help us steer clear of potential pitfalls. 

On a larger scale, learning from other's experiences can help us understand the nature of reality better and put us in a better position to make more informed decisions. By gaining insights from those who have gone before us, we can become more prepared for our own experiences. We can study their approaches, their successes and their failures, and use that knowledge to our advantage.

A midnight curfew on the weekends provides teens with the opportunity do positive activities, such as homework and getting extra sleep, while avoiding the potential dangers associated with being out late at night. It also forces teens to prioritize their extracurriculars and other activities, allowing them to focus on their education.

On the other hand, imposing a weekday curfew of 10pm may be seen as too restrictive for teenagers, who need to take part in activities that will be beneficial for their futures. Without the opportunity to attend extracurriculars and engage in after-school activities — such as internships and volunteer work — certain teens may face a disadvantage when it comes to the college admissions game and even job applications. Further, a strict curfew can make teens feel isolated, as if belonging to a family or community is denied. This can lead to teenagers feeling unwelcome in their own homes, resulting in depression and even delinquency.

Therefore, when it comes to implementing a curfew on teenagers between the ages of 16 to 18, it is important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of the midnight weekend curfew and the 10 p.m. weekday curfew. On the one hand, a curfew can foster a feeling of safety and security for teens. On the other hand, it can impose unfair restrictions, hindering them from succeeding academically, emotionally, and economically.",AI

Most common societies expect students to identify a career by the age of 18 or 19. Personally, I think the best age to start figuring out a career path is as soon as one can. Young people are often faced with difficult decisions such as deciding which college to attend, or what job to pursue. When my parents gave me four years to decide on a career, I was overwhelmed and questioned if I was making the right decision. My advice to young people who are trying to figure out what career path to follow is to talk to mentors, explore different opportunities, and trust that you can make decisions that will help shape your future.",AI

One of the most common aspects of success is learning how to deal with failure. Despite many successful people having to face failure, they were able to learn from it and turn it into an opportunity for growth. It's not easy to deal with failure, especially when you have high expectations. When someone is afraid of failure, the best way to motivate them is to remind them that failure can be a lesson in the journey and that it shouldn't stop them from trying to reach their goals. To succeed in difficult challenges, it's important to stay positive and prepared. If something isn't working, you can try something different and be open to exploring different opportunities.  Taking a proactive attitude and reframing failure as a learning experience can be a great way to approach any difficult challenge.  Personally, I have experienced both failure and success in different situations. There have been times when I've been close to giving up, only to find that the steps I took to change my perspective ultimately paid off. Taking the initiative to give something a different approach and keeping a positive outlook has certainly helped me better navigate my own experiences with failure and success.",AI

Failure has been described as the stepping-stone to success. It is an integral part of life that can teach us great lessons. Without failure, people lose the motivation to make the necessary changes in order to achieve success. My own experience is a testament to this: I failed my first attempt at university, but this only motivated me to work harder and eventually I graduated with honors.

Moreover, many successful historical figures have gone through significant amounts of failure before achieving greatness. For instance, Albert Einstein failed Grade 7 at school, yet he is now one of the most well-known scientists in the world. Likewise, Oprah Winfrey was formerly fired from a job due to her race, yet she went on to become one of the most successful TV talk show hosts.

These examples demonstrate that failure is often a necessary part of success. It instills valuable lessons and teaches resilience, which is often required for success. By viewing failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, it becomes the very tool that can lead to success.",AI

Distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for high school students, offering a variety of benefits. For students with jobs, distance learning allows them to complete school work around their work schedule, meaning they can manage both without feeling overwhelmed. For those needing last-minute credits, distance learning provides the flexibility to take classes outside of traditional school hours. Additionally, for students with physical or psychological disabilities, distance learning provides the ideal learning environment that caters to their individual needs. 

Furthermore, distance learning can provide more time for homework, rest, job-related activities, and visiting other places. Not only that, but distance learning can also open up opportunities for students to gain knowledge and experience in topics they may not have been exposed to while in a regular school setting. This means that students may have more access to more specialized courses that may help them achieve their educational and professional goals. With the right resources and support, distance learning can give students the opportunity to develop their skills and fulfill their ambitions.",AI

It is not uncommon for young teenagers to dream of a career and make the decision to pursue a specific career path in their teenage years. While there are some advantages to deciding on a career at an early age, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered. 

The primary advantage of young teenagers choosing to pursue a career early is that it can give them a head start on their desired career. By starting earlier, teens can gain more experience, explore available options, and earn qualifications that can accelerate their progress. Teens who pursue this approach are also likely to have a greater clarity regarding their career choices when they become adults. 

However, there are some important disadvantages to young teenagers making the decision to pursue a specific career. One of the primary drawbacks is that, although teenagers may have a clear idea of what they want to do, they may not take into account any personal and professional changes that may occur as they enter adulthood. Additionally, teens can often become so focused on one career that they miss out on various other opportunities, especially if the chosen career path doesn’t work out. 

In conclusion, while deciding on a career path in teenage years can give young people a significant advantage, there are potential risks in making this decision too early. It is important for teens to consider their options carefully and think about the potential upsides and downsides before committing to a specific career path.",AI

In this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one’s own character traits and the implications that they can have. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they’re wearing on any given day. For example, if someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. On the other hand, someone in a more toned-down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person’s character is unique to them. 

Having a “good character” is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful. It’s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful life much easier. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. Friends and family can be more confident in the trustworthiness of the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. 

It is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday life. In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state of mind, it is important to take the time and effort to work on the self and improve their character. ",AI

Winston Churchill's statement that ""success is marked by failure"" is an important reminder that failure is an inevitable part of life and a necessary component of success when striving for our goals. Failure should be seen as an opportunity for learning and growth; it allows us to make mistakes and learn from them, helping us to refine our skills and better our chances of achieving our goals in life. Furthermore, when faced with problem-solving, failure can also teach us to look at things from different perspectives. Instead of becoming discouraged by mistakes, we can use our failures to fuel our motivation and put us on the path to success.",AI

Extending the school day is a controversial issue that has been gaining attention in recent years. On the one hand, it can provide additional time for teachers to cover topics in more depth. It can also give students the opportunity to explore new extracurricular activities. On the other hand, it can lead to issues such as student fatigue and an increased workload for students and teachers. 

Proponents of extending the school day argue that the extra time provided can help students get tutoring or extra help from teachers if needed. It can also allow schools to introduce enrichment activities such as field trips, robotics, music, and art. With more instructional time available, students can explore more in-depth subject matter and may even get the chance to explore topics that are often omitted from the standard curriculum. 

Opponents, however, express concern that extending the school day would lead to increased student fatigue. With the current school day already being long, any additional time can be taxing on students' energy levels and school performance. These students may end up feeling exhausted and demotivated, which could lead to a decrease in their academic performance. It could also lead to mental health concerns if students don't have adequate rest and leisure time. 

It is important to remember that extending the school day has many advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to extend the school day should take into account the unique requirements and needs of each school community. Educators and parents should carefully consider all the pros and cons before making a decision on this issue.",AI

The debate surrounding the amount of summer vacation and winter break for students is a longstanding one. There are numerous benefits and drawbacks to changing this amount of time off. On the one hand, a longer break could be beneficial to students, as it would provide them with more time to recuperate from the rigors of the school year and take part in activities that promote growth and development. On the other hand, a shorter break could enable students to remain on track academically and allow them to make the most of their time off. 

The opinions of students on the proposed changes to vacation time vary greatly. Some feel that a longer break would give them more time to relax and focus on those activities that promote physical, mental, and social growth. Others argue that a shorter break would allow them to stay on top of their studies and capture the momentum they've established throughout the year. 

In conclusion, it is difficult to reach a definite position on the issue of changing the amount of vacation time for students. Each student may have different opinions on the matter, making it important to consider each individual opinion before making a decision for the entire student body.",AI

Excerpt:
Failure can be a formidable opponent, but it is also an opportunity to reset and begin anew. Through the lens of self-motivation, there is no greater tool to learn from failure and turn it into a catalyst for success. I know this from personal experience. Growing up, I was filled with doubt and mistrust of my abilities. After a few failed attempts at pursuing a passion, I felt disconnected and unsure of my place in the world. It wasn't until I began to believe in my own strengths and refused to let failure define me that I felt empowered to continue on. I now strive for success in everything I do, but only after having embraced failure and its importance in helping me become the person I am today.",AI

Living a life of meaning and fulfillment means learning from our failures and embracing every experience with enthusiasm. After some reflection on my own life, I have come to agree with Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”. 

I discovered the importance of this quote when I was applying for a job after graduating college. Despite learning important skills in the university and preparing extensively, I was rejected from the position I wanted the most. Although I was aware of the possibility of rejection, the actual experience was incredibly disheartening. However, instead of letting it dampen my spirits, I chose to use it as a learning opportunity. After analyzing what went wrong in the application process, I applied to more positions and kept my enthusiasm up by challenging myself with new experiences. After months of hard work and dedication, I finally got the job I wanted.

This experience taught me the importance of keeping enthusiasm in the face of failure. Even when I fail, I always try to dust myself off and keep pushing forward with enthusiasm and an open mindset. I have also learned to evaluate why I failed and use it as an opportunity to grow. From this experience, I have learned to never settle — no matter how many times I fail. By taking heed of Churchill’s words, I always strive to keep an energized outlook on the future and use failure as a learning opportunity.",AI

The potential introduction of a rule requiring all high school students to take courses during the summer, evenings, or weekends in order to finish school faster, has a wide range of implications to consider. For immigrant students, this could be especially challenging, due to cultural, financial, and language barriers they may face. It could also be difficult on the teachers, who would be expected to teach the courses on top of their current workload and without receiving additional compensation. Furthermore, this rule could have a detrimental effect on the free time of all students, taking away invaluable time they would otherwise spend engaging in hobbies, sports, educational trips, and socializing with their family and friends. In considering the potential creation of such a rule, it would be wise for decision-makers to weigh these factors carefully.",AI

Performing acts of kindness is a great way to bring joy and comfort to those around us. I recently experienced a situation that showed just how beneficial these kinds of acts can be.

I was visiting a local farm with a friend when we noticed that a nearby chicken was struggling to get free of some brambles that had grown over its coop. Although we were in a hurry to get home, my friend decided to help the chicken after seeing it trapped and unable to escape.

She knelt down and began carefully picking away the brambles from the chicken's enclosure, allowing the chicken to wiggle free. As she was doing so, the chicken started clucking in a content manner. It was a strange but heartwarming sight.

Seeing this act of kindness touched me deeply. It showed me that one random act of kindness can make a difference in someone else's life, even if it's something as small as freeing a chicken from some brambles. By performing this act of kindness, my friend had made a difference not just for the chicken, but for me too. I had gotten to witness an act of kindness that had made both of us feel wonderful.

From this experience, I can say that performing even just one act of kindness can have a positive impact on the people involved. It creates a shared sense of joy and contentment, and helps demonstrate the importance of kindness and compassion in our lives. In addition, it can generally inspire people to do more acts of kindness for others.

It is my hope that more people take the opportunity to perform random acts of kindness wherever possible. Doing so can help to foster a more generally understanding and compassionate society. Additionally, it is a great way to give something back to the community and make the world a better place. Even the smallest acts of kindness can have a big impact.",AI

Online classes present a unique opportunity for students to learn without attending a traditional school setting. The convenience of online classes is twofold; on the one hand, they can be taken from anywhere without the need to catch a bus or spend time commuting, plus students can attend class when they are sick and don’t have to worry about being marked absent or behind in their curriculum. On the other hand, they also provide flexible schedules where students can start their day at a later time than a traditional school day, making it easier to fit around the other commitments in their lives. 

While there are obvious advantages to taking online classes, there are potential drawbacks as well. For example, constantly looking at a bright computer screen for long duration can strain eyes, and the risk of distractions due to the comfortable environment of home can be high. Furthermore, the lack of a physical classroom with peers and an instructor can also make it harder to stay motivated.",AI

Graduating high school in three years instead of four has many potential benefits. First, students are able to take courses in the summer and in evenings to reduce the amount of time spent in school. This can also be a way to save money on tuition or other fees associated with college. In addition, students who graduate high school early have more time to focus on a job or internship. This could mean gaining skills and experience to prepare them for college, or earn money to help pay for college tuition. 

On the other hand, graduating high school in three years instead of four could put students at a disadvantage. A key part of the high school experience is learning important social skills which may be difficult to learn in a shorter time frame. While taking courses in the summer or evenings in order to graduate early can be beneficial, it is also possible for students to become overwhelmed with too much academic work in a short amount of time. 

Ultimately, graduating high school in three years can be a positive experience, but it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages before making a decision. Taking courses in the summer or evenings, working an extra year to save money for college, and the opportunity to focus on skills and experience all make graduating high school early a viable option for some students.",AI

When it comes to the challenges associated with working alone, common difficulties include lack of motivation, isolation, distractions, and difficulty accessing resources. To combat these issues, it is often useful to create a strict daily schedule and set specific goals to keep yourself motivated and on task. If you are working away from an office or other group setting, it also helps to use organizational tools, such as applications or digital tools, to keep track of tasks and collaborate with colleagues, if necessary. Additionally, it is important to stay mindful of your mental and physical wellbeing by taking regular breaks and finding ways to socialize, such as scheduling calls with peers. 

Unlike working alone, working in a group affords us the opportunity to learn from one another, get a variety of perspectives on a given project, have access to more creative resources, and stay energized and inspired by exchanging ideas. Additionally, because collaborations require more communication, you will likely form stronger connections with your peers, which can help build relationships and spark creativity down the line.

In terms of music, it can be a great resource for creating a calm and productive atmosphere. Instrumental music, in particular, can reduce interference from sound-based distractions while also providing a sense of motivation and flow. Other useful resources for working alone include virtual tools that allow you to collaborate with colleagues, online training sessions that allow you to develop new skills, online networking events to socialize with colleagues, and motivational podcasts that can help keep you inspired in your work.",AI

Distance learning may have its advantages for those who are unable to attend physical classes due to challenging family or work commitments. However, it is important to consider that students may not be able to benefit fully from this style of learning.

The main issue is that this environment is full of potential distractions. Students may be easily tempted by electronic devices or the company of their parents, siblings or friends. This means that much of their attention is potentially not focused on school work, which can have a detrimental effect on their progress and educational attainment.

Another concern is that some students may find distance learning dull, and struggle to concentrate and learn on their own. Without the support of their teacher, the individualised guidance needed to fully understand concepts or problems might be lacking. This can lead to them feeling disengaged with their education, and reluctant to continue to learn.

Finally, due to the lack of a physical break in a technician's routine, fatigue can easily impair their concentration and performance. Without physical activity, regular breaks and structure, students may feel overwhelmed or exhausted by having to make it through the day, which can lead to issues with maintaining mental and physical health.

In conclusion, despite some advantages, distance learning does not necessarily provide an ideal environment for students who wish to focus on their studies. The potential for multiple distractions, lack of teacher guidance and added stress of regular study on their own, can create difficulties for learners who are looking to excel in their chosen field.",AI

Introduction: 
Longer school days have become a controversial issue as of late. While some argue that extending school days would have educational and social benefits, I am against the idea of adding one and a half hour to school days. This essay will detail four main reasons why this should not be implemented. 

Reason 1: We are already in school for 8 hours and it is too much. Eight hours is already a long time to spend in school. Times are different since the introduction of digital devices in education, and children may struggle to focus on tasks and activities so long into the day. As their brains tire, so does their capacity for learning.

Reason 2: We don't have enough time for personal activities. Having a longer school day would mean less free time in the afternoon for students to learn valuable activities, like how to manage their finances, pursue hobbies, cooking, time with family, and much more. 

Reason 3: Too much homework. Having a longer school day means more homework for students and puts greater pressure on them. Even if teachers spread out assignments and give manageable homework, a longer school day will result in massive piles of assignments. 

Reason 4: Appointments are missed. Students and their families may find it almost impossible to juggle appointments, such as counseling, medical, and a range of other services in and around a longer school day. Such appointments are crucial, and an impossibly long school day could lead to missed opportunities for numerous students.  

In conclusion, I believe the idea of adding another one and a half hours to school days should be abandoned in favor of shorter days and better educational methods. The additional time taken up by longer school days is unnecessary and could lead to detrimental consequences for both students and teachers.",AI

With the increasing use of technology in our lives, many of us are becoming increasingly disconnected from our physical and emotional worlds. We now spend our days staring at screens, tapping away on devices and skimming through digital content, rather than engaging with the world around us. Here are five reasons why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. 

Firstly, I believe it's important to keep a balance between technological and natural elements of life. Too much time spent with screens and devices will lead us to miss out on important connections and experiences found in the real world, such as interactions with nature, conversations with our peers, and simply the joy of physical play outside. For example, a recent outing to the beach with family has highlighted the beauty of our natural environment and the importance of connecting with the physical world.

Secondly, the heavy reliance on technology can be detrimental to our mental health. Mental health researchers now suggest heavy use of technology can lead to a range of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. By shutting out reality and replacing it with the digital one, we neglect our need for meaningful human interaction and emotional attachment.

Thirdly, technology can be a huge distraction from tasks we need to complete. Apps such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat have the potential to keep us on our devices for hours, without us even realising it. We can lose precious time that could be spent on more important tasks or even relaxation activities such as going for a walk, reading a book or listening to music. 

Fourthly, technology can make us lazy. Instead of walking to the local store or post office, we can just order what we need online. We no longer have to leave our homes for entertainment, we can just access that online instead. Eventually this can lead to a decrease in physical fitness, leading to further health issues. 

Finally, misuse of technology could potentially lead to cybercrime or other forms of digital fraud. We can fall into the trap of clicking on malicious links or downloading software from false sources, leaving our personal information exposed and vulnerable.

It is clear why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. In order to live a balanced and fulfilling life, we must be mindful of the amount of time we spend interacting with technology and taking it away from other activities.",AI

The implementation of a healthier cafeteria menu could be hugely beneficial for students. Eating right is a fundamental part of staying healthy, and by having better options in the cafeteria, students can make better food choices that align with their physical and mental well-being. Not only that, having access to a balanced and nutritious school lunch could lead to improved academic performance due to the increased energy and mental focus associated with a healthier diet. Moreover, real-life examples demonstrate the positive outcomes of transitioning to a healthier cafeteria menu, such as reduced rates of obesity and greater physical fitness among students. In summary, schools should strive to maintain a cafeteria menu that focuses on providing a variety of nutritious and delicious meal options for students, and a transition from a junk food menu to a healthier one is an excellent way to start.",AI

Field trips have become an integral part of the educational experience, and the impact they can have on students’ mental and physical well-being is becoming more evident. Spending too much time in one location can increase levels of stress and fatigue in both students and teachers. Taking regular breaks outside, or in new locations, can provide beneficial physical and psychological effects on students. These breaks can help break up the monotony of staying in the same educational environment, and can also provide an opportunity for students to explore new and interesting places.

When comparing educational experiences had within the school building, and those done on field trips, it can be argued that field trips offer the most beneficial opportunities. Field trips offer students the chance to experience educational activities outside the classroom while discovering new places and surroundings. This can also help foster strong and lasting relationships between students and their surroundings. Therefore, it is clear that field trips are an incredibly valuable opportunity for middle school aged children, and their continued inclusion in school curriculum is beneficial.",AI

Teaching math to elementary school students is an invaluable task that fosters development of essential skills. Math provides children with an opportunity to develop logical reasoning, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. It also helps students understand the world around them better, as math applies to many aspects of life, such as counting money and measuring distances. Math introduces many key concepts in a hands-on, concrete way that lays the foundation for more advanced learning. As children become more confident working with numbers, they begin to build confidence in other areas of life, too. This can help them excel in more difficult academics, such as algebra and calculus, which are increasingly important later in life. Ultimately, teaching math to young learners is essential to hone their problem-solving and logical reasoning skills, as well as set them up for success in the future.",AI

With the recent push to focus more on core education, the addition of electives such as music, art, and drama classes in high school could be a great way to introduce students to a varied curriculum. While these classes often have minimal instructional value in terms of getting good grades, they still offer plenty of potential benefits for students. By offering these classes, students have the opportunity to explore their creative sides, develop critical thinking skills, learn how to work with others, and gain an appreciation for art, music, and drama. 

On the downside, making these classes electives can be seen as creating an unfair advantage for students who can afford to spend more time or money on them. For example, if a student is from a wealthy family, they may be able to purchase expensive instruments or pay for private art classes, while a student from a less privileged background may not be able to access the same opportunities. Furthermore, if other courses like math and science are not seen as important due to the presence of these electives, then students may be less inclined to focus on pursuing a fulfilling, successful career path. 

At the end of the day, the potential benefits and drawbacks of making music, art, and drama classes electives at high school should be considered carefully in order to make the right decision for all students.",AI

Conserving energy is one of the most important elements of sustainability and resource conservation. It is important to conserve energy both financially and ecologically — environmentally-friendly energy conservation can lead to economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money on energy bills. Additionally, conserving energy can help to reduce reliance on natural resources like paper, such as in an academic setting. Teachers can encourage students to move away from traditional paper-based learning activities and use digital applications instead. There are also many ways individuals can help conserve energy in everyday life, such as turning off lights when leaving a room, washing clothes in cold water, buying products with the Energy Star label, and recycling. By conserving energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and make significant cost savings.",AI

For students considering graduating high school in less than the traditional four year time frame, there are several advantages and disadvantages of that choice to consider. The most significant advantage is cost savings; students can save up to half a year's tuition by graduating in three years compared to four. Graduating early also allows for increased college course work in the remaining time, giving students the opportunity to impress college admissions offices. 

On the other hand, although graduating early will help save money, students who choose this route may not have had the opportunity to take as many classes as those who completed the traditional four years. When it comes to college preparedness, this is an important factor to consider. Additionally, graduating in three years may leave students feeling as though they are missing out on a major part of their high school experience in the form of sports teams, clubs, and other activities.

In my opinion, students should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early before making the decision to do so. Graduating early can be beneficial depending on the individual's goals and needs. It may be easier to get ahead in college preparedness through a three year plan, while maintaining the full high school experience and taking all the available classes may be the best fit for others. Ultimately, the decision is a personal one and should be taken into consideration with care.",AI

As part of my research, I have identified several benefits of eating healthier food. Eating healthy foods is essential for maintaining an optimal level of energy, reducing the risk of serious illness, and improving overall health. Changes to the school's lunch menu can play a major role in encouraging students to make healthier choices. 

By focusing on providing more wholesome options such as fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy snacks, we can increase the number of healthy options on the menu. This shift in focus can also help de-emphasize unhealthy options such as processed snacks, sugary drinks, and unhealthy condiments.

I would like to present this information to the school principal to discuss the need for an improved lunch menu with healthier options that are designed to meet the dietary needs of students.",AI

Making your own decisions is essential for a healthy and prosperous life. When we have the freedom and autonomy to make decisions, we gain a sense of self-ownership and control over our destiny. By having the ability to choose our own path, we can be empowered to seek out the best opportunities available to us and create a future that is full of possibility. 

Take marriage as an example. This is one of the most important decisions we make in life, and one that many of us delegate to others. When we make our own decisions about who we marry, or even if we don’t marry, we can ensure that the individual we select is a genuine partner, on whom we can depend. In addition, we can evaluate the pros and cons of the relationship and consider our own needs and goals.

Relocation is another key decision that should be made of your own accord. While it is often a common expectation to follow in the footsteps of someone else, such as our parents, it is important to recognize that our lives are our own and that if we want to pursue something different, then we should be allowed to do so. Making our own decisions on relocation opens up a world of possibilities, allowing us to explore new experiences and discover what brings us true happiness and success. 

In addition, the importance of being able to make our own decisions can be seen in our capacity to recognize the good and the bad in life. While most of us are predisposed to stick with the status quo, including ideas and beliefs that have been passed down to us from previous generations, it is only when we make our own decisions that we are able to critically evaluate any potential risks or rewards associated with our decisions. This customizing of our mental framework leads to greater self-awareness and enables us to make informed decisions. 

Overall, making your own decisions is a fundamental aspect of an enriching and fulfilling life, and when we take control of our destiny, we can shape our lives to our satisfaction.",AI

The accomplishments of Mahatma Gandhi, Bill Gates, and Nelson Mandela all demonstrate that hard work and dedication can lead to success. Mahatma Gandhi fought for India's independence through peaceful protests and civil disobedience, which eventually resulted in India's independence in 1947. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University to form Microsoft, growing it into the largest software company in the world. Nelson Mandela successfully campaigned to end the apartheid system and introduce democracy in South Africa. 

Thomas Jefferson's quote ""I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it"" speaks to the idea that hard work can lead to success. This has been exemplified by these individuals, and is evidence that setting goals and working diligently to achieve them can lead to a successful outcome.",AI

Enthusiasm is one of the most important qualities for achieving success. It is an essential mindset to have when tackling challenging tasks and it can be the key to reaching our goals. To illustrate this point, we can look at the example of Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother. 

Known for his hard-working attitude and enthusiasm on the football pitch, Cristiano Ronaldo has gone on to become one of the most decorated footballers of all time. His enthusiasm for his sport has been instrumental in his development into one of the greatest players of all time. His enthusiasm also keeps him motivated to keep performing at a high level; something that clearly shows in his game.

My mother is another example of someone who has seen success due to her enthusiasm; she went from being unemployed to running a successful catering business. She was passionate about creating a business, and her enthusiasm for the work kept her motivated to pursue her dreams. Her enthusiasm was crucial in helping her to stay focused and motivated, and without it she might not have achieved the success she enjoys today.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is essential for success. When pursuing our dreams, we must maintain an enthusiastic and hard-working attitude. Examples such as Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother illustrate how this attitude can lead to great success.",AI

In recent years, technology has become an integral part of our lives, with many of us constantly connected to the online world through our phones, tablets, and laptops. This increased access to technology has brought with it both advantages and disadvantages in the social dynamic, especially for the younger generations. 

In terms of the classroom, being surrounded by digital screens can make it difficult for students to engage in face-to-face communication. Technology can make it difficult for students to interact both in the physical space of the classroom as well as with one another on an emotional level. This can manifest itself in disruptive behavior, such as students talking over one another in conversations or physical aggression. 

Moreover, the ease of access to the internet can also make individuals particularly vulnerable to online bullying. One example is that of Sarah, a young student, who was cyber-bullied by her peers for her choice of clothing. Despite trying to ignore the comments out of fear, she became increasingly isolated as her peers began to ostracize her. 

The prevalence of online trolling and fake news can also add to the mental stress and social burden of those who use the internet. Fake news can misinform and mislead people, which can lead to social misunderstandings and false impressions. Online trolling usually involves malicious remarks and hurtful language, which can make individuals of any age feel insecure. 

Given the sheer complexity of the issue, it is important to explore different methods to reduce the detrimental impact of technology on students' social skills. Strategies such as providing students with access to mental health services, emphasizing the importance of in-person interaction, and encouraging digital literacy can help to some extent. Ultimately, it is important for teachers and parents to strive for a balance between technological use in the classroom and fostering physical interaction.",AI

Poverty, depression, relationships, need, and peer pressure are all external factors that can have a profound effect on someone’s behavior over time. Many people turn to vices in an effort to escape from a difficult situation. For example, children born into poverty may lose hope in life, resulting in destructive behavioral trends such as addiction or criminal activities. Similarly, depressed individuals may use drugs or alcohol as a means of coping with their condition. 

Relationships can also impact a person’s behavior. Many people in abusive relationships may suffer from low self-esteem, leading to compromised decision-making or reckless and dangerous actions. Peer pressure can also be a powerful influence, particularly among young people. Teens often feel obligated to conform to their peers’ behaviors, even if those behaviors are dangerous or wrong. 

People are strongly affected by the external forces around them. While the aforementioned factors can lead to negative behavior, it is important to remember that no one is predestined to a life of destruction. It is never too late to take control of one’s behavior and seek out positive influences that will lead to a more productive life.",AI

Valuing yourself is essential to living a healthy and meaningful life. No matter who you are or where you come from, every person deserves to be respected and treated with kindness and consideration. Having someone to look up to as an example can be empowering, providing inspiration to help us reach our full potential and strive for greatness. When things don’t go as expected, it’s important to practice self-compassion. Instead of beating yourself up or believing you are not “good enough,” it’s best to accept that sometimes we make mistakes and learn from those experiences. And when we are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of what to do, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Doing so can open up a world of possibilities, giving us access to resources and knowledge that can help us in times of need.

Recent research has shown that older students in school can have a positive influence on younger students. For example, by providing guidance and advice, the older student can help lead a younger student through difficult subject matter or give them encouragement and direction when it comes to their academic work. Additionally, there has been evidence that older students can act as mentors for younger students in areas where the older students have struggled themselves. This allows the younger students to relate to the situations better, trust the advice given and be more willing to try the tasks themselves. Furthermore, the older student's presence in helping with service hours can give younger students a sense of purpose. With the sense of responsibility they get from helping, young students may become more invested in their school and academic work. All in all, having older students provide guidance and leadership to younger students in a school setting can have a number of positive effects.",AI

Changes to the policy that requires students to have an A or B grade to participate in sports would have a variety of implications. The most obvious implication would be that students with lower grades would be allowed to participate in sports, which could ultimately result in an increase in student participation. However, this could have both positive and negative side effects. On the positive side, allowing lower-performing students to participate in sports could inspire them to strive for better grades in order to stay in the sport. On the other hand, allowing lower-performing students to participate could make them less inclined to put in the extra effort necessary to get an A or B grade, or to attend classes, as they may come to rely on sports as their primary source of motivation. Further, this could create an atmosphere in which the more successful students, who may have chosen to participate in sports as a reward for their hard work, would become discouraged and potentially less inclined to maintain their high grades. Consequently, all aspects of student effort, grades, and behavior should be carefully considered before instituting changes to this policy.",AI

Research shows that recognizing a student's efforts can have a positive impact on their self-esteem and self-confidence. Studies have revealed that teacher recognition can motivate students to challenge themselves and work hard to reach their goals. Some people believe that teachers should only give recognition for work that meets or exceeds expectations, while others argue that recognition should still be given for effort, even when the results achieved are not up to expected standards. For example, a teacher might recognize a student with a 'try again' sticker, to show the student's effort was appreciated even though their work wasn't quite successful. Ultimately, it is up to the teacher to decide when and based on what criteria recognition should be given, although studies have found that recognition of any kind is beneficial.",AI

Winston Churchill famously said that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" Indeed, failure is an integral part of the pursuit of success, and understanding why is essential to maximizing your potential. Not many people are a failure of their success because, with the right approach, failure can be used to inform our decisions and propel us to heights we would never have achieved without it. 

The first example of why not many people are a failure of their success is perseverance. The individuals who refuse to give up in the face of adversity are the ones who can achieve great things. Thomas Edison failed more than 1,000 times in his pursuit of the right combination of materials to make a reliable and durable light bulb, yet he kept trying until he achieved his goal. His ability to persevere through failure was the key to success in the end. 

The second example of why not many people are a failure of their success is resilience. Those who can stay focused when under pressure, avoid giving up, and keep their vision alive will eventually be rewarded. For example, when Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, he had to start over from scratch. After all the failure and setbacks, he eventually returned to build one of the most successful companies in the world. 

Many people are also inspired by what they are going, and using failure as an opportunity to learn and grow can be especially empowering. Every time we fail, we get a chance to re-evaluate and adjust our strategies, develop new skills, and become more knowledgeable and determined. For instance, after Oprah Winfrey was fired from her television job at the age of 22, she used the experience to her advantage. She was determined to make something out of the failure and learn from it, and that’s exactly what she did. 

Finally, many people are drawn to failure because it provides a sense of achievement. Facing failure is not easy, but it encourages us to reach beyond our comfort zone and accomplish something extraordinary. Consider Amelia Earhart, who wanted to make history and become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She accepted failure as part of the process, and used her courage and determination to make her dream come true. 

In conclusion, failure can play an important role in the pursuit of success, if we choose to take advantage of it. By being resilient, inspired, and",AI

The Ancient Greek storyteller Aesop was famous for conveying profound lessons in his fables. One piece of advice that Aesop often repeated was to ""not waste any act of kindness"". Why this phrase has sustained for centuries is because its truth is timeless. Every small act of kindness can, quite literally, help change the world. As a result, we should never turn down the opportunity to do something good for someone else, no matter how small it may be. 

For example, a simple gesture such as holding the door for someone or giving up your seat on the train may seem insignificant, but it could make a significant impact on the other person. It may be the only act of kindness that they receive that day, and they may think about it long after it has passed. Similarly, a kind word of encouragement given to someone during a tough time can do wonders. It can show them that they are not alone and that somebody is there to support them. 

Overall, Aesop's words of wisdom carry a deep meaning and remind us of how even the smallest of kindnesses can have a meaningful impact. When we perform acts of kindness, we spread happiness not only to others, but to ourselves. Therefore, it is important to respect and practice the Ancient Greek storyteller's advice to ""not waste any act of kindness"".",AI

Making a strong first impression is incredibly important in life. It can set the tone for how people perceive you, even influencing how you are treated later on. This is particularly true of situations such as job interviews, college admissions, and meeting people in social settings. Put simply, if you make a good first impression, it is easier to make relationships, get hired, and succeed.

However, making a good first impression is not always easy, as it relies heavily upon the beholder's subjective assessment. Unfortunately, this means it can be difficult to change a first impression once it has been established. For example, if you come off as shy or uninterested during an interview, the hiring manager may decide that the person they're interviewing is not the right fit for the job. Moreover, if you do get the job, there may always be an underlying impression of you as being unenthusiastic, making it harder to climb the ladder at the company.

In conclusion, it is essential to make a strong first impression, as it can make or break your opportunities in life. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to recover from a bad one. The best way to ensure a successful first impression in any situation is to be prepared, engage actively with the other party, and come off as confident and genuinely interested in the situation.",AI

In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work.

Learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to directly interact with teachers and other students, which can foster collaboration and discussion and help deepen one's understanding of the material. On the other hand, there can often be distractions in the classroom, such as other students talking or texts and emails buzzing, that can disrupt one's focus. 

In contrast, learning in a home setting can be incredibly effective, as there is usually fewer distractions and a more relaxed environment. As well, if a student finds they are struggling with a topic, they can usually take more time to go back over it without feeling rushed or put on the spot. However, without direct feedback from a teacher or other students, some learners may feel too isolated or lack the motivation to stay on track. 

No matter what setting it takes place in, effective learning happens when one takes responsibility for their own learning and is willing and motivated to make the most of any environment.",AI

The argument over whether teenagers should have a 10 pm curfew revolves around the tradeoff between safety and rest. Research has shown a direct correlation between lack of sleep and poor academic performance, risky behavior, depression, and other issues among adolescents. For these reasons, many parents and experts feel there are benefits to a 10 pm curfew, as it sets a framework for teens to get enough rest while still being able to maintain an active lifestyle. 

On the other hand, there may be counter-arguments to a 10 pm curfew, such as the fact that teens may simply stay home, rather than engage in activities that contribute to their development and growth. As well, some people may consider a 10 pm curfew as overbearing, potentially giving parents too much control over their children.

The right to choose elective classes is of the utmost importance for students. This choice allows students to explore different interests, diversify their education, and pursue passions both in and outside of their normal academic endeavors. Forcing students to take every elective class can be a waste of time because it does not allow for students to follow natural inclinations that are unique to them. 

Not every student enjoys the same classes, and it is to the benefit of the student, teacher, and school system if students are able to explore what they are genuinely interested in. This will encourage diligent study and draw out a creative and thoughtful approach to new material. Having the freedom to pick and choose elective classes can also open the student up to unexpected interests they may not have known to have before. 

Requiring students to take a certain set of elective classes could also result in a time-consuming process without a significant educational benefit. Students can be made to complete classes they have little interest in, joining in lectures with minimal engagement or enthusiasm. If students had more choice, their motivation and improved engagement could lead to better learning. 

In conclusion, allowing students the choice of what elective classes to take is of the utmost importance.

The advancement of technology has caused many negative impacts on people's lives, ranging from cultural, social, and emotional issues to intellectual ones. Culture is the most significantly affected; technology has created a more homogenous and globalized society in which different cultures can easily interact and exchange ideas in ways never before possible. This has many positive effects, but has also caused many cultures to feel homogenized or to disappear altogether.

When it comes to communication, technology is largely responsible for both good and bad. On the one hand, technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people from around the world, but this has also caused a reliance on screens and keyboards as opposed to face-to-face interaction. Ironically, the tools that connect us have caused many of us to become disconnected from those around us.

In terms of knowledge, technology has made valuable information available to all, but has also caused a decrease in analytical and critical thinking skills. With the ease of access to information, many people no longer take the time to carefully analyze and reflect on issues.

Furthermore, technology has had a detrimental effect on curiosity. With the abundance of information at our fingertips, the time and effort spent exploring and discovering new things are on a downward trend.

Lastly, technology has had a profound effect on our happiness. While technology has a vast array of benefits, it has the potential to lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety when misused. Oftentimes, people are so consumed with technology that they displace their relationships with real people.

Extending school by two hours has been proposed in the past as a way to improve students' academic performance and overall well-being. Although this may seem ideal on paper, this extended model is not without issue.

First, fathers may become less present and involved in their children’s lives. With the extended school day, fathers have less time to spend with their children and, in some cases, these extra two hours are better spent in pursuit of a career or another passion. Fathers want to be involved in the lives of their children, so extending the school day may create tension and discontent within the home.

Second, extended school days may place too much strain on students. A longer day means more hours of learning and responsibility. This not only takes time away from relaxing at home but also may cause students to become burned out and disconnected from the physical and mental activities that can improve their strengths and well-being.

Third, with an extended school day, students may not have the time to explore other activities that are important for their own development. Such activities may include sports, music lessons, and volunteer work – activities that involve the body and the mind, and that are necessary to a rounded curriculum. 

Finally, there are other alternatives instead of extending the school day. These include early start programs, where students start their day two hours earlier, or lengthening the entire school year. By keeping the school day the same but battle this pacing battle by lengthening the entire school year, schools are providing more time for students to learn and discover.

Dear Principal, 

I'm writing to express my views on the school's new sports policy. As you know, the policy has had a significant impact on our student body, myself included. I strongly believe that all students should be given the opportunity to participate in the sports they wish to take part in, no matter their interests or abilities. Not only does this provide students with a much-needed outlet for creative expression but it also encourages physical activity and healthy competition.

Unfortunately, there are some students who have been severely impacted by this policy who are now turning to criminal activities as a result. Although the policy states that students should be given the opportunity to play their chosen sport, many are not being given the same treatment. As a consequence, some students are dropping out, pursuing illicit activities, and in some cases becoming victims themselves. This is a disservice to these students as well as a huge source of disruption to the school. 

I believe that it is essential to provide all students with the chance to participate in the sports they are interested in, as this can help foster a positive environment and reduce the chances of criminal activity. It is my hope that the school will reconsider its current policy and make adjustments to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to take part. Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]",AI

When discussing success, one of the first things that come to mind is soccer. The careers of soccer players have always been inspiring and motivational, as they exemplify the beauty of hard work paying off. But behind the glamor, the stories of these players include many challenges and difficult paths. Success in soccer often comes from dedication and sacrifice, requiring players to spend countless hours in training, managing expectations, and mastering the craft. To truly become successful, players must be able to overcome any obstacle they face, from battling injuries to dealing with discouragement.

Idleness is a common challenge that can hold people back from achieving success. As anyone who has ever struggled with a lack of motivation can attest to, it can be difficult to break the cycle. To overcome this, people must identify the root causes and focus on the end goal, using positive motivation and visualizating a desired outcome. While external praise and rewards can certainly be motivating, it is important to focus on intrinsic rewards that depend solely on personal efforts, as this will allow an individual to better sustain longterm motivation.

By setting goals and continually pushing towards them, individuals can make progress and become successful. It is important to stay focused on the process, and to be passionate about pursuing dreams and aspirations. With hard work and dedication, anyone can reach the heights of success, just as so many successful soccer players have done in the past.",AI

Imagination is an essential part of the human experience, and the need for it surpasses that of knowledge in many areas of life. From early childhood activities such as math, building, and drawing/designing, imagination plays an incredibly important role. In mathematics, for instance, imagination allows us to create new equations, solve problems, or make improvements to existing models. With building, imagination is the key to creating new structures, inventing new tools, and developing creative solutions to complex technical problems. And finally, with drawing and designing, imagination is the foundation for creating works of art that express the uniqueness of an individual's personality. 

Albert Einstein famously said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.” When presented with this quote, it is easy to understand why imagination is so critical in life. It is the driving force behind true innovation and creativity, enabling people to step out of their comfort zones to create something that has never been thought of before.

Living in a world where people try to force others to conform can be incredibly detrimental to our well-being, both mentally and physically. By being pressured into conforming, we risk sacrificing our individual sense of identity and originality for the sake of fitting in among everyone else. We may try to emulate the behaviors and looks that those around us have adopted, and in doing so, we may be blind to our own carefully crafted uniqueness. 

We may also become lost in a sea of sameness, where it seems as though everyone experiences the same scenarios, and the same trials and tribulations. By refusing to highlight our individual preferences, beliefs and even our quirks, we may end up leaving ourselves isolated and disconnected from other people. It is important to remember that by embracing our distinctive characteristics, we are able to form individual opinions and interpretations of the world, and this can lead to better understanding of ourselves, our peers and the world as a whole. 

Finally, there is an element of danger in trying to fit into a group if it involves participating in activities that deviate from our personal moral and ethical standards. We risk subscrib- ing to some potentially harmful ideas which can, in the long run, prove extremely detrimental for us.

In conclusion, living in a world where people try to force others to conform often leads to very negative outcomes. In order to stay true to ourselves, we must evaluate the decisions we make in regards to conforming to the behavior of those around us and make sure that our individual values are not compromised in the process.",AI

To sustain enthusiasm and resilience throughout our lives in order to achieve our goals, it is important to develop our own personal strategies for dealing with depression and disappointment.

One strategy is to focus on the positives in any situation. Make it a point to savor accomplishments and embrace the journey of learning and growth, even if it's during a difficult period. Another key approach is to foster a positive and resilient mindset. Change our internal dialogue from ""This is too hard"" to ""I can do this.""

Family and friends are also significant resources for staying motivated. Having an accountability partner, even just checking in every once in a while, can remind us of our goals and inspire us to make progress. We can also draw strength and motivation from the people around us. My grandmother, for example, kept going in her job well past retirement age because she was passionate about her work and enjoyed being surrounded by a positive and supportive community.

Though there are certain challenges that life throws our way, with the right frame of mind and the right support system, we can conquer almost anything. As long as we remember to stay optimistic, stay motivated, and always remember why we are striving, we will be able to achieve our goals.",AI

As I explored the different types of musical instruments I discovered the rewards that playing one could bring. I decided to learn the violin and have been diligently practicing ever since. I joined a local orchestra and had the pleasure of making new friends who shared similar interests. With my newfound confidence, I've even begun to travel to different states and connect with more musicians.

Along the way, I've learned several important lessons about the world and myself; most notably, that music is a powerful form of expression and communication. As the months went by, I began to grow more confident in my abilities and found that I was able to communicate better with others. From this experience, I've gained an appreciation for music, made wonderful new friends, and learned more than I ever could have imagined.",AI

Individual competition in the workplace can provide beneficial advantages to employees looking for a competitive edge. It can foster a sense of competition and promote healthy risk-taking, pushing employees out of their comfort zones in order to reach higher goals. For those who are successful in achieving these goals, the rewards of the competition are high as they can gain recognition and experience productive growth in their career. Additionally, individual competition can foster creativity and innovation, as challenges can act as an incentive to solve problems quickly and find new, more efficient solutions. Competition can also establish personal accountability, meaning that employees are more likely to take ownership in their work and be driven to produce better results.  In this way, individual competition in the workplace can be an effective tool to help contribute to the success of a worker.",AI

As society progresses further, we are increasingly reliant on experts to guide us in our decisions. What does it mean to be an expert in any area? To be an expert is to be an authority in your field, someone who others turn to for knowledge and advice. This can come with great responsibility, but with it also come certain privileges. 

On the one hand, being an expert means that you may feel a large burden of accountability. Many people, from those asking the questions to those benefiting from the answer, are depending on the accuracy and quality of your work. This can be difficult, as it is not always easy to please everyone. On the other hand, being an expert means you hold a certain amount of power due to your knowledge and experience. It can be easy to forget the power that comes with being an expert, but those who can remain humble and wise will often be able to make wiser decisions and more inspiring leads. 

Overall, it is a great honor to be an expert in any field. Holding such a responsibility means that you will have the potential to benefit and influence many people. However, one should never forget the pressure and accountability that goes alongside such a position, and should strive to remain humble in order to make wise and informed decisions.",AI

An act of kindness is a voluntary act of generosity. It is a selfless act that can be done with no expectation of recognition or reward. It can range from a simple “thank you” to a hug or to an extreme act such as donating money, volunteering time or helping a complete stranger. The primary outcome of an act of kindness is the feeling of being appreciated and valued. It is known to have a lasting impact on people and improve the overall safety and happiness of those around them. 

For example, when a homeless person on the street receives a hot meal or a trinket from a passerby, the feeling of kindness and the appreciation felt can spread, even to those not necessarily involved. It can have a ripple effect within the community, inspiring others to do something kind for someone in need. It can also help build a sense of community, bringing people together that would have otherwise been strangers.

Of course, even the smallest act of kindness can be incredibly powerful. Helping a friend in need, lending a fresher friend some notes, or even merely smiling can make a big difference to someone. The mere gesture of kindness can significantly boost a person’s self-esteem and even start a chain reaction of kindness.",AI

Partnering with companies in the field students are interested in pursuing provides a wealth of benefits. Through such partnerships, students can acquire the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen career. Student partnerships offer the opportunity to gain real-world experience and exposure to the industry by attending conferences and seminars, networking within the industry, or gaining a better understanding of the company’s technology or product. Additionally, such partnerships give students the chance to build relationships with influential people, which can lead to job offers, internships, and other professional benefits.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to these partnerships. Companies are looking for the best and brightest talent, and some students may feel pressure to meet these expectations. Furthermore, developing relationships with industry professionals can add extra time demands and strain to an already busy academic schedule. Lastly, there is the risk that students may not be adequately prepared for the challenges of such partnerships, so it is important to assess individual capabilities before entering into a student-company partnership.",AI

Thomas Jefferson believed that productivity was essential for personal growth and development. He wrote in a letter to William C. Jarvis, ""Determine never to be idle…It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson recognized the potential power of consistent effort and encouraged others to stay busy in order to achieve worthwhile goals. 

At the same time, Jefferson believed that inactivity could have an important role to play in how we use our time. In his view, moments of pause could lead to reflection, contemplation, and self-examination–all of which are critical mental exercises that can lead to increased productivity, once motivation has been restored. 

When seeking to maximize our productivity, it is important to differentiate between Idle activities and productive activities. Idle activities, such as watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing video games, can​ be enjoyable, but can also reduce our motivation and prevent us from reaching our goals. Productive activities, such as research, problem-solving, reading, and project-building, can help us to pursue our ambitions and are important for personal growth. 

To accomplish more, we must set achievable goals and use our time wisely. To achieve our goals, we must utilize strategies such as breaking them up into manageable parts, setting a timeline for completion, and utilizing motivational techniques. Making a conscious effort to focus our efforts on productive activities rather than idle ones may also help us to be more successful in reaching our goals. ",AI

Taking action rather than being a passive dreamer has three key advantages: 

First, taking action will make your dreams more achievable. Instead of languishing in the hypothetical, you can take concrete steps toward making your goals a reality. For example, if you want to get a new job, you can take action by researching companies in your industry, updating your resume, and attending networking events.

Second, taking action helps you gain momentum. When you take one step, it’s easier to take the next. With each new action you take, you’ll find yourself closer to your goal. For example, if you’re starting a business, you might take action by researching potential markets, writing a business plan, and creating a website.

Lastly, taking action can help you make meaningful connections. Taking actions in pursuit of a goal can open you up to new relationships and collaborations. For example, if you’re trying to launch a project, you can take action by joining relevant Facebook groups, attending local meetups, and actively engaging with potential collaborators.

By taking action as opposed to just dreaming, you can make your goals more achievable, gain momentum, and build meaningful connections - three clear reasons to take action rather than remain inactive.",AI

Homework clubs, where students can gather to work on school assignments, have been shown to offer a number of potential benefits. Students that take part in organized homework clubs display increased engagement in school and improved academic performance. Studies have also shown that these clubs reduce feelings of isolation and stress, and can provide students with a better sense of community during their school years. From the teacher perspective, the availability of a homework club can provide a greater opportunity to monitor students’ work, and to ensure they can catch up on course work if they miss classes. 

At the same time, there are some potential drawbacks. Teachers may not be available to help with specific coursework during homework clubs, thus making it difficult for students to access help for questions related to the subject material. Moreover, a lack of resources or funding may limit the effectiveness of the program, or make it difficult to sustain long-term. 

It is important to consider all the potential pros and cons of having a homework club in schools as part of an overall approach to student engagement, mental health, and academic success. With proper resources, teachers’ availability, and student engagement, the benefits of a homework club may outweigh the risks.",AI

As I began to master the basics of coding, I realized that I had a newfound confidence in my abilities. What I had previously considered to be so far out of my reach became something that I could actually achieve. Suddenly, learning something new felt easier, as I had a solid foundation that I could build from.

To continue learning, I adopted strategies such as breaking down large problems into smaller ones, reviewing the solutions to challenges others had faced and expanding my horizons by learning new coding languages. I also observed colleagues who had already mastered one skill and moved onto learning another. They taught themselves entirely new concepts and achieved amazing results.

Community service is an invaluable asset to society, as it allows individuals to become better citizens of their communities and countries. It also serves as a great opportunity for youth to get involved with their local communities and gain hands-on experience. For this reason, it is important for schools to ensure that all students have a chance to partake in community service. 

Principals can decide who should participate in community service in a few ways. For instance, they could require each student to complete a certain number of hours of community service per semester, host activities and events that allow students to participate and provide credit or rewards for completed projects. Additionally, they could create a club or organization that provides community service projects or partner with outside organizations that do the same. 

As an example, an elementary school principal could choose to partner with a local food bank and provide an opportunity for students to volunteer on the weekends. The students could assist in stocking shelves, sorting donations, or helping to package meals for those in need. This would be an excellent opportunity for the students to learn about the importance of giving back to their community while providing a valuable service. 

In conclusion, community service is an essential part of becoming an effective citizen. Schools should prioritize providing students with opportunities to give back to their community and principals should ensure that all students have a chance to participate.",AI

In an era increasingly dominated by technology, it’s easy to forget how crucial human connections are in our daily lives. Texts, emails, social media platforms, and video calls can bridge distances, but they cannot replace the physical presence of another person. That’s why it’s essential that we take a break from technology now and then and simply speak to one another.

Talking to people—not just online, but face-to-face—plays a vital role in encouraging emotional connections. It gives us a chance to step outside of our comfort zone, become more mindful of our surroundings, and share something meaningful with someone else. In addition to that, conversing with someone can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve a person’s outlook on life, and foster a sense of belonging.

It’s important to remember that human connection takes effort. Not everyone is comfortable talking about their emotions or problems, and that’s okay. Even small talk can be beneficial—it’s still an opportunity to practice conversation and maintain social norms. Taking regular breaks from technology and talking to someone can boost your overall well-being and make a lasting impact in your life.",AI

First impressions are powerful. They can shape our behavior towards a person in an often unintentional or unconscious manner. It's amazing how one look or response in a meeting can make our opinion of a person. But what's even more special is that sometimes, these impressions are so powerful that no matter what a person does after, the first impression remains unchanged. 

This can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, first impressions may help us pick up on traits of a person we may have otherwise overlooked. On the other hand, it may be difficult to sort out our own preconceptions and remain open-minded. That's why it's important to remember that first impressions don't always tell the full story. Despite this, it's important to accept people for who they are and respect them, rather than falling back on our own preconceptions.",AI

As our research has indicated, there are a variety of community service requirements for elementary school students that have been implemented in our school district. To further benefit our students and the district, I am proposing a program that would require our students to participate in community service as part of our curriculum.

This program comes with a variety of benefits, including the development of a greater sense of social responsibility, increased awareness of important social issues, improved academic performance and enhanced interpersonal and leadership skills. Furthermore, this requirement would help our students gain valuable communication and problem-solving skills, as well as better understand the needs of the community around them.

In order to ensure that all our students are able to participate in the program, we need to put in place certain criteria that would identify those who are interested in participating in the program. We would need to identify qualified tutors that could supervise our students during the program and arrange the necessary transportation for those who might need it. Additionally, by asking our parents and local community to make donations we will be able to provide any resources or materials that might be necessary for our program. Finally, we need to decide on the activities and length of the program in order to ensure that we can provide a meaningful experience for our students.",AI

Success is an elusive goal that requires hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to never give up. Every successful person has faced setbacks, disappointments, and numerous challenges, but they never gave up. They kept going even in the face of adversity. When we keep pushing forward despite life's obstacles, we learn to appreciate the hard-earned victories that come with success. 

When we persist in spite of challenges, we become stronger and more capable. The effort and energy we put in comes at a cost, but we learn valuable lessons along the way which can later be applied in our personal and professional lives. Every situation, no matter how difficult, is an opportunity to learn and grow. With each victory, we become more confident and optimistic. The belief that we can overcome any obstacle gives us the courage and strength to keep fighting.

Another advantage of not giving up prematurely is that we learn how to face our fears and push through. If we stop whenever things become inconvenient, our potential will never be reached. We must be willing to take risks and accept that failure is part of the process. With patience and practice, we learn how to find solutions and move past any problem.

In order to reach our fullest potential, it is important to never give up. We must have a resilient mentality and an optimistic outlook in order to ensure success. We must be willing to put in the effort necessary to reach our goals. Not giving up despite challenges is essential to achieving success.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement that ""Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too,"" speaks to embracing the benefits of trying something new and going beyond one's comfort zone. Eating a healthy diet is one example of expanding one's horizons – by eating nutritious foods, one can gain the energy and minerals needed to perform the necessary work to move toward their desired goal. Changing one's looks can also be beneficial in terms of achieving goals. A fresh look can give the individual a sense of renewed confidence and determination to approach tasks with vigor. Additionally, Emerson's message also speaks to the opinion of short people and encourages them to expand their repertoire and take on roles that may have been otherwise inaccessible. By pushing the boundaries of their current limitations, short people can develop the skills, passion, and ambition to create beautiful spaces of opportunity. Ultimately, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement reaffirms the message that by taking calculated risks and pushing boundaries, one can find success and new purpose in life.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson, an iconic philosopher, once said: ""Do not go where the path may lead, Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail"". This quote contains a powerful message that we can all strive to achieve anything we set our minds to, no matter how daunting the task. 

Recently, I have researched new things I want to try, such as learning a foreign language, writing a novel, or traveling to a new country. To accomplish such goals, I have outlined a process of setting small, achievable goals that will eventually lead to the larger goal. For each smaller goal, I plan to dedicate the time and effort necessary to achieve it. Knowing that the outcome is not guaranteed, I am keeping an open mind and reminding myself that nothing is impossible given the right amount of perseverance and hard work.

Just as important as it is to push yourself and challenge yourself, it is also important to realize that failure is a part of life. Instead of getting stuck in the fear of the unknown, it is important to take risks and try something new. Failure is inevitable, but it can also be a learning experience that will help you"", although such lessons may be hard to learn. 

The difference between people who limit themselves and those who aim for the stars is the willingness to take chances and face the fear of the unknown. To have a successful life, it is necessary to eliminate the fear of trying something new and challenge yourself to go out of your comfort zone. Doing this will allow you to explore new things, gain wisdom, and experience a sense of personal accomplishment.",AI

Distance learning is a popular alternative to in-person classes at school, offering more flexible class schedules and allowing students to learn from the comfort of their own homes. While online learning can generally be more convenient and cost-effective, there are some potential drawbacks, as well. For instance, distance learning may lack the social aspect of traditional school. In-person classes often give students the opportunity to connect with their peers and teachers, providing collaborative learning experiences. In addition, it can be more difficult to stay motivated with distance learning, as students don't have structured environments or built-in support systems. 

On the other hand, distance learning can provide more freedom and flexibility for students with busy schedules. With more advanced technology, online learning can offer interactive resources and additional content that may be difficult to duplicate in traditional settings. Moreover, distance learning may offer more personalized instruction, since teachers can work closely with individual students or small groups.

The benefits of participating in extracurricular activities are numerous; not only do they provide students with an opportunity to practice real-world skills relevant to their fields of interest, they also bolster a student's overall educational experience, help foster creativity, and even increase a student's chances of obtaining employment upon graduation. However, one factor that should be considered when researching the impact of extracurricular activities on a student's grades is the amount of time they need to devote to the activity. The more time they take away from academic pursuits, the more likely it is to impact their grade-point average. This means that grades should factor into a student's ability to participate in activities, and they should be willing and able to balance their academic performance with their extra-curricular activities.",AI

In his essay 'On Motion and Merit', Thomas Jefferson argues that we should embrace labor and constant movement in order to live our most fulfilling lives. He believes that it is excellence, rather than idleness or comfort that create true happiness. He states that ""incessant execution of labor is the only proof of our existence, and, as long as we are executing, we cease to be mere shadows, and become real and living things.” 

Jefferson's perspective can be applied to the world today by valuing effort and dedication. In the modern era, hard work is often a key factor in finding success and achieving individual goals. For example, when studying for a degree or preparing for a job interview, the amount of effort and dedication a person puts into their task will be reflected in the results. The same principle can be applied to any challenge; those who strive to excel and devote themselves to their tasks will be rewarded with greater satisfaction and personal growth.

In conclusion, Jefferson's views on constant work and motion can be applicable to the world today. While hard work and dedication may not always have an immediate reward, in the long run they enable us to lead more fulfilling lives and excel in whatever challenge we face.",AI

Nelson Mandela, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and president of South Africa, is a powerful example of how embracing one's individuality can be empowering, particularly in moments of uncertainty. Despite facing adversity, Mandela embraced his distinctive identity and fought for his principles. Despite being imprisoned for decades by the South African government for his political beliefs, Mandela never abandoned his commitment to justice and his pursuit of equality for all people. 

The strength of character that Mandela displayed in pursuit of his goals, standing in defiance of the norms of the time, demonstrated that embracing one's uniqueness is essential to overcoming difficult obstacles. His refusal to accept the status quo and embrace his own authentic individual identity empowered him to continue his advocacy for justice and his pursuit of a better life for all South Africans, no matter their background. 

Ultimately, Nelson Mandela's story serves as a reminder of the importance of embracing one's individuality and not cowering in moments of uncertainty.

The debate surrounding the mandatory requirement for students to take music, drama, art, or other elective classes in order to graduate high school carries rich nuances. On the one hand, having to participate in a mandatory class of this kind can be seen as a form of exploration, exposing teens to opportunities they might not have otherwise sought out. It can also be seen to help foster creativity and impart interpersonal skills that can prove beneficial both inside and outside the classroom setting.

On the other hand, many view these mandatory classes as more of a nuisance than a boon for students, as they can be seen as detracting from the more significant courses and studies necessary to prepare students for college. For students who may not have a developed interest in the chosen subject, this can be an imposition, forcing them to take time away from their core studies. It is for this reason that such policies have often raised the issue of equity when it comes to students, especially those from underserved or disadvantaged backgrounds.

In conclusion, when it comes to the policy of requiring students to take music, drama, art, or other elective classes to graduate high school, it is clear that there are pros and cons to consider.

In recent years, many students have opted to pursue their education from home and experience the new way of distance learning. As with any major decision, there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to consider. 

Distance learning presents several advantages, including cost savings, convenience, and ability to customize one's own learning environment. With distance learning, students are able to study and learn online, eliminating the need to attend classes in person. This can be especially beneficial for students who are pressed for time or need to work around other commitments. Additionally, distance learning often provides a more cost effective option than traditional schooling, as students do not need to pay for transportation or expensive textbooks and materials. 

Despite the benefits, distance learning can also present challenges. One of the main drawbacks is that subtracting the human presence from the classroom can cause distraction and loneliness. It is difficult for students to stay motivated and organized when they are in charge of their own time management, and the lack of face-to-face interaction in the classroom may leave students feeling isolated. In addition, students may not receive the same level of individual guidance from a teacher or professor, so they must be proficient in self-study and problem solving. 

Ultimately, whether or not distance learning is beneficial will largely depend on an individual student’s circumstances and learning style. It is important to consider the possible pros and cons of this type of education, and make an informed decision about whether taking classes from home is the best choice for achieving one’s educational goals.",AI

An extended school day can have both positive and negative effects on student life. On the positive side, extra hours could lead to improved academic performance. Students would have more time to complete assignments, receive extra help from teachers, or even attend additional academic or extracurricular activities. In addition, the long days may provide students with a sense of structure and purpose that can be difficult to beat at home.

On the other hand, adding hours to a student's school schedule can be a considerable strain, leading to fewer opportunities for leisure or extracurricular activities. It can also lead to increased fatigue, anxiety, or distraction. Additionally, students with already-busy schedules may find it difficult to fit the extra hours into their day-to-day lives. 

Ultimately, the decision to add more hours to the school day should be taken carefully, and should address the particular needs of the student body. Increased hours could be beneficial if balanced properly with additional, restorative activities; however, the long hours of a fully packed schedule can be difficult for many students to manage.

Enacting a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew is a controversial way to curb crime and promote healthy lifestyles among teenagers. On one hand, this measure could help reduce the number of late-night incidents involving teenagers, promoting their safety and citizens’ security. On the other hand, it could also restrict their freedom and limit recreational activities.   

For teenagers, a curfew could be beneficial in keeping them out of potentially dangerous situations and limiting exposure to dangerous elements in the streets at night. Parents would also benefit from a curfew, as it can reduce anxiety about their children’s safety and reaffirm their trust in the community’s ability to protect its members. However, teenagers may feel resentful if their freedom is restricted and feel deprived of opportunities for extracurricular activities and late-night socializing. 

Overall, a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew can be a useful tool for protecting teenagers and reducing crime.

    Every student has their own set of reasons for wanting to or not finishing school, but a critical factor is their access to support and guidance. Parents have a great responsibility in ensuring their son's educational success when it comes to providing encouragement, a safe learning environment, and taking an active role in decision-making. Students may also face challenges in managing their time effectively between school work and a job, leading to life imbalances that can impede academic progress. Additionally, family problems that arise can easily distract students from giving their best effort in the classroom. 

For those without parents, it is important to keep your brain active through self-motivation and dedication. While it may be difficult to differentiate between the distractions of the everyday, seeking out alternative sources of inspiration such as mentors or peers can help spotlight the importance of knowledge. Furthermore, some students may encounter language barriers that slow their academic development; to avoid this, it is essential to identify and connect with appropriate native language classes or a tutor to help expand their academic vocabulary. 

Above all, the importance of having a high school diploma should never be undermined. Educational attainment is a huge milestone in life, providing the structure for building a successful future. Each student should strive to complete their high school education for the vast opportunities this yields.",AI

After researching various ways to conserve energy and resources in schools, I've identified several possible projects and campaigns that can be implemented. These initiatives include installing low-flow fixtures in sinks and toilets, building student awareness of energy and water conservation through educational campaigns, and encouraging campus recycling efforts. 

In order to present these initiatives to the school board, I would recommend creating a proposal that outlines the goals of each project and campaign, the benefits of conservation, and a description of how each can be implemented and maintained. 

The school board may also raise the issue of extending the school day by two hours, which could lead to conflict between students, teachers, and board members. This could be managed through a survey that gauges the opinion of the school community and through a series of informational meetings to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of the proposed extension.

Working in a group has many benefits. It is a positive step to take in any situation as it allows for multiple perspectives to come together to form more creative solutions and achieve greater results.

One of the major benefits of working in a group is the ability to collaborate and share ideas. Having multiple minds working on a project allows for a more diverse set of ideas and solutions. This can be especially useful when tackling complex problems that require creativity and out of the box thinking. Furthermore, working together also encourages shared responsibility, which can lead to increased motivation and higher work productivity.

Another advantage to working in a group is the ability to gain insights from multiple experienced individuals. Each person will bring their own unique skills, talents, and experiences to the table which can strengthen the team’s understanding of the project as a whole. Being able to bounce ideas off of each other and discuss potential solutions will ultimately result in a more solid plan of action.

In conclusion, it is clear that working in a group provides many benefits and should always be considered when tackling any project. The ability to collaborate, share ideas, and gain insights is invaluable and has the potential to lead to more successful outcomes.",AI

Working independently and working in a group both have their advantages when working on a school project. When working independently, one has the opportunity to responsibly manage their own time and decide which tasks need to be completed and when. This allows the individual to work without being influenced by anyone else’s presence or ideas. On the other hand, when working in a group, members can bounce ideas off of one another to come up with more robust solutions and develop their communication and collaboration skills. Working in a group also provides shared accountability, allowing each member to feel supported in completing their part of the assignment. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take on a school project depends on the skills and preferences of the individuals involved.",AI

Studying and gaining new information and skills is essential for future job prospects. Attending classes, either in person or online, can expand one's knowledge of the latest trends in their respective field. While there are numerous benefits to attending classes, there are also potential challenges students may face depending on their location and resources available. For instance, if distance is an issue, attending a physical class may be difficult. Alternatively, students with access to technology may find that online classes provide greater flexibility. Moreover, different opportunities are available to students depending on their prior educational experience and skills attained. For example, some may benefit more from college courses while others may receive greater benefit from vocational classes. In sum, by researching and understanding the benefits and challenges of attending classes, a student can take advantage of available educational opportunities to benefit their future job prospects.",AI

An employer's decision to hire a candidate is based on many components, one of which is experience. While having extensive experience can often make an individual a top pick for a job opening, employers also benefit from considering applicants who have little to no experience. Those who lack experience have fewer preconceived notions about the job and can bring fresh perspectives to challenges. Additionally, they can be trained more quickly and cost-effectively. 

Aspiring employees who have limited or no experience can succeed by demonstrating their hard work, diligent study, and dedication to the job. During an interview, candidates should highlight their unique strengths and explain how their ambition and eagerness to learn can be an advantage. Moreover, having them focus on the skills and characteristics that can be acquired through the job itself can help potential employers to accurately assess them for the role.

Nevertheless, should an employer incorrectly judge potential employees based on experience alone, it could lead to hiring the wrong candidate. Therefore, it is important for employers to holistically assess each candidate's skillset to determine who would be the best fit for the job.",AI

When it comes to life advice, it is always wise to get opinions from multiple people. Drawing from a variety of sources and perspectives provides a robust set of ideas to consider and helps to ensure that no stone is left unturned. As an example, if you’re trying to make the important decision of whether to go back to school and pursue a new degree, consulting with your family, mentors, or friends can be helpful in understanding different angles and potential outcomes. 

Having multiple people weigh in on a decision can provide the support and confidence necessary to move forward; hearing different perspectives also reminds us to be flexible and to remain open to new possibilities, while keeping sight of our own personal values and goals. This is especially true in instances when a single opinion or valued opinion may not be sufficient. For example, if you are planning to make a career change you may need to talk to people who have successfully gone through the transition in order to recognize potential obstacles and create a realistic plan. 

Getting advice from multiple people allows us to benefit from everyone’s individual experiences, paving the way to a knighted path of informed decisions. All in all, leveraging feedback from multiple sources can be a rewarding and incredibly enriching venture on our life journeys.",AI

First impressions can have an immense effect on the success of relationships, both personal and professional. People often make assumptions based on first impressions, whether it's a job applicant's clothing or the body language of a person they're meeting for the first time. Positive first impressions can lead to further conversations that help foster strong relationships and lay the groundwork for successful interactions in the future. An example of a positive first impression is when two co-workers initially meet and find common ground by sharing an interest in a certain hobby or activity. On the other hand, negative first impressions can lead to misunderstandings that can damage relationships before they even have the chance to begin. An example of a negative first impression could be when two people are meeting for the first time and one seems uninterested in what the other is saying, coming off as disinterested or rude. While first impressions may not always be accurate, they can have a lasting impact and it is important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others in order to create a positive impression.",AI

Intergenerational educational programs are a great way for both young and old students to come together and learn from one another while also helping each other. This type of program is important in order to bridge the gap between the generations, build understanding, and foster collaboration. It also gives children and teens the opportunity to learn from experienced adults, and adults the chance to stay informed on technological developments. Moreover, these programs give students a platform to understand the different perspectives, beliefs, and values of the older and younger generations. 

This type of program should benefit students from primary school to university level. Teacher facilitated co-learning settings can help kids build connections that will help them succeed and grow in the long-term. University students can gain valuable insight and access resources from experienced colleagues as mentors.

Despite some students' enthusiasm for a three-year high school graduation program, there are many reasons why it should not be allowed. Most readily apparent are the limited availability to attend classes after school and the high stress levels involved when attempting to fit a four year program into three years. Extracurricular activities are also affected, as students must choose between priority activities that will help them get into college and activities that better reflect their interests.

Furthermore, a lack of a three year program could have several benefits for the student. It would give them time to work and gain experience in the field of their choice, it would mean they would be better able to focus on their studies, and it would also serve to prepare them adequately for higher education.

Considering these points, it is clear that a three-year high school program is not appropriate and should not be allowed. It can cause stress and affects extracurricular activities, while the lack of such a program could prove beneficial to many.",AI

As people, we all understand the importance of making a good first impression. This is especially true in professional and dating situations, where we want to put our best foot forward and ensure a pleasant and successful exchange. However, some people might argue that first impressions are “almost impossible” to change. I disagree with this statement, as I believe that first impressions can be changed and improved through thoughtful consideration and action.

Although making that initial strong impression typically takes less than a few seconds, it is a moment that can influence the present and future relationship. With that said, I believe that first impressions can be purposefully shifted with a strong intention and dedicated effort. For example, if I make a mistake during a job interview, I can take the time to apologize, explain the situation in appropriate and honest detail, and move on, showing how I have learned and grown from the experience. Similarly, if I have a heated argument early in a relationship, I can work respectfully and compassionately to bridge the gap with the other person.

Therefore, first impressions can be improved, but the degree of difficulty will depend on both the mistake and the situation. We must all consider our first impressions carefully, recognizing that they can be powerful but not binding. Through communication, respect, and effort, I believe that the negative assumptions associated with a first impression can be managed and, ultimately, overcome.",AI

Having a five-day school week compared to a four-day school week offers several advantages. Students have more flexibility to manage their time and responsibilities more efficiently. For example, rather than attending school all five days, they can participate in a part-time job after school, have time for sports or extracurricular activities, and still have sufficient time to complete homework assignments. A five-day school week provides a more consistent and predictable scheduling model which makes it easer to keep up with coursework.

On the other hand, there are potential drawbacks to adopting a four-day school week, such as extended school days that could lead to fatigue and burnout. The shortened school week may also cause issues with childcare and scheduling. Additionally, there are some concerns that a four-day school week may not provide enough time for students to get the education they need in order to be successful academically.",AI

Though first impressions can tell you a lot about a person, they have the potential to be misleading. I remember when I first met my best friend. I had heard rumors that she was a wild party girl, so I expected her to be loud and obnoxious when I met her. However, she was actually quite shy and sweet. After spending more time with her and getting to know her, I found out that she was actually more of a homebody than a party person. 

Though first impressions can heavily influence the opinion you form of a person, I believe that an opinion can change as you get to know someone better. When I got to know my best friend better, I was able to see her true personality and appreciate her kindness and intelligence.

However, first impressions are usually hard to change. Once someone forms an opinion of another person, it is difficult to persuade them to think differently. No matter how many facts a person may be presented with, first impressions are often the most powerful influence.",AI

Gaining attention through pretense is a complicated concept. It can often be seen as a negative behavior, suggesting a lack of confidence or even a sense of insecurity. When someone attempts to appear as something they're not in order to draw others to them, it is important to consider how this relates to self-esteem. There may be a fear of rejection or simply a desire to make an impression, but ultimately it is important to recognize the underlying cause. Furthermore, it is necessary to be aware of double standards. Pretending to be someone you're not to gain attention can be especially damaging if done by someone of a certain gender or sexual orientation since those people often face greater scrutiny for their behavior. On the other hand, there is also something to be said for keeping a small circle of trusted people in one's personal life. Feeling comfortable in a close-knit group can be a key factor in avoiding the need to portray a false persona in order to gain attention.",AI

It is common for high school and college students to feel uncertain about their future careers. In fact, many students do not have the ability to commit to a career path at such a young age. This can be attributed to several factors.

First, students are often still exploring their interests and trying to find their specialties in order to decide which field or profession to pursue. This process can take time and often involves trying out a variety of experiences, such as volunteer work, internships, and educational courses. Additionally, in an ever-changing economy, the job market may be in flux, which can make it difficult to determine where to invest time and resources.

Labour market research further evidences this point. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most individuals work an average of 12 different jobs throughout their lives, with the average person spending almost five years in each job. This indicates that career commitment does not come quickly nor easily; rather, it is a process which takes time and exploration of various interests and potential opportunities.

Moreover, young people are still developing their skills, values, and interests—all of which can greatly influence job choice. The Department of Labor’s Transition and Career Explorations Toolkit states that “students must be able to identify and explore their individual, career-related preferences and interests before they can begin to consider and make informed career choices”. This further suggests that young individuals may not be sufficiently informed or knowledgeable about a given field or profession in order to make a career commitment.

In conclusion, it is understandable why so many students lack the ability to commit to a career at a young age. This is due to a combination of factors, ranging from a still-developing skillset to a changing job market to identifying personal interests. With time, research, exploration, and advisement, however, students can easily develop a deeper understanding of available career paths and come to an informed decision.",AI

Confidence is an important factor when it comes to achieving anything—whether it is in our personal or professional lives. This raises the question of whether having self-confidence before achieving a goal or experience is necessary for our success.

I believe that having self-confidence is the first step of all achievers, big or small. Having confidence in oneself gives us the motivation and drive to strive for what we want in life, even when the odds are against us. For example, an aspiring author may be confident in their abilities to write a book, even if they don’t have any published works yet. They will be encouraged to keep going and stay motivated because of their internal belief in their skills.

On the other hand, lacking confidence can lead to a negative attitude towards achieving goals. When we don’t believe in ourselves, we may doubt our potential and give up on our ambitions. An entrepreneur may forgo a promising opportunity out of fear of failure because they lack self-confidence. This would lead to missed opportunities and ultimately, leads to an unfulfilled life.

In conclusion, for any achievements—big or small—self-confidence is the key. It is the all-important catalyst that helps us to move forward with our goals, despite the odds. With self-confidence, we can stay motivated and persevere in the pursuit of our goals. Without it, we may lack the necessary drive to see our aspirations through.",AI

Success and failure are essential parts of the human experience, but how we confront them can completely change the values that we take away from each. Famous personalities such as Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling all encountered failure before rising to greatness. By analyzing their approaches to failure, we can uncover which behaviors and attitudes can help turn a stumble into a success. 

Walt Disney was fired from his first newspaper job due to “lacking creativity”, but refused to allow this setback to deter him. Instead, he used the experience to both identify his strengths and passions and to grow as a creative thinker and entrepreneur. Steve Jobs, too, experienced numerous rejections when first launching his business, but was able to reframe his disappointed into determination and achieve major success. 

J.K. Rowling struggled with extreme poverty and depression before “Harry Potter” was released. Her story speaks to the power of hope and enthusiasm, as she was able to remain resistant to defeat and keep pushing forward. These real life examples show us that a positive outlook can be an extremely valuable tool when overcoming failure. 

Failure can be a great opportunity to learn more about ourselves and our capabilities. It can give us a greater appreciation for success, reveal our strengths and weaknesses, and offer valuable lessons ­for the future. Thus, developing strong self-awareness and keeping a positive attitude can help individuals cope with disappointing setbacks and lead them to brighter opportunities. 

This essay has discussed how some of the most successful individuals in history have made use of failure. It has discussed how Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling have used resiliency and positive thinking to soar beyond their setbacks and pointed to the importance of developing self-awareness and remaining hopeful in the face of difficulty. In doing so, it has illustrated how failure can ultimately assist in achieving triumphant success.",AI

Conformity can be a controling force in our lives if we're not careful to examine the repercussions of what we do. Society is constantly changing and evolving, so it stands to reason that if we want to reach success and keep the people we love in our lives, we must be willing to go beyond merely following the status quo.

Living within the boundaries of society comes with certain expectations and standards that may not align with our best interests. It often creates a false sense of security, trapping us in a cycle of “doing what’s expected.” This is why it's so important to recognize our own agency and not feel inhibited by the inescapable label of conformity.

In order to break away from the chains of conformity and realize our own potential, we should strive to be different. We should be adventurous in our pursuits, open-minded in our thoughts, and allow ourselves to explore different avenues with an optimistic outlook. Refusing to limit our ability to think, act and experience the world differently opens the door to seizing greater opportunities and relationships.

Going beyond conformity is a challenge. It involves taking risks, pushing ourselves into unknown territory and continuously adapting to unforeseen difficulties. However, it is only by doing this that we can break out of our bubble and experience true success not only for ourselves, but also for the people we care about.",AI

One of the major advantages to taking an online class is the convenience it provides to students. They don't have to worry about commuting to class each day, or having their schedules interrupted by classes. Furthermore, online classes often allow for more flexible pacing, allowing students to work at their own speed.

However, there are some drawbacks to taking online classes too. The lack of in-person interaction with a teacher and other students can lead to feelings of isolation. Also, traditional classroom settings usually provide a structure and organization that can be more difficult to achieve in an online class. Technical issues such as internet connection and compatibility with the courseware can cause frustration for students as well.

To address these issues, online courses should provide a robust discussion forum and interactive elements such as live video sessions or quizzes. It's also important for teachers to remain available to answer students' questions and provide assistance when needed.

In conclusion, while online classes offer many advantages, there are some potential problems that can be avoided or minimized with the right planning and implementation. With the right support structures in place, online courses can be a valid and successful educational option for students.",AI

Attending classes at school provides unique advantages not available through online classes. For example, attending school provides students with face-to-face communication with their peers and instructors. Additionally, a physical campus allows for collaboration between students in groups which can be difficult to replicate online. 

On the other hand, taking classes online has its own advantages. It allows students to learn from any location, providing a greater degree of flexibility than attending classes in person. Moreover, online classes might be more accessible in terms of price and having higher technology-related requirements in order for the student to attend their classes. 

If everyone took classes online, schools would face the challenge of fewer students attending. This could lead to fewer resources available for students, a possibly reduced class selection, and the disruption of field trips and extracurriculars due to lack of participation. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased school spirit and a feeling of disconnect from the school community overall.",AI

Research indicates that pairing older students with younger students through school programs can have a positive impact on both parties, regardless of age. Studies conducted suggest that younger students are more likely to excel academically when working and collaborating with older peers. This is due to the fact that older students tend to have more advanced knowledge in the given subject, as well as more experience and skills working in a team. 

Older students, on the other hand, benefit from enrolling in peer-mentoring programs by gaining more responsibility and increasing their social skills. The positive reinforcement from teaching younger students can be an invaluable experience for older students, resulting in increased self-satisfaction and confidence.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many students to transition to learning from home through online or video conferencing. Although this is a revolutionary move towards modern education, students may not benefit from learning remotely. In fact, students learning from home can face many potential challenges. 

First, without access to a physical classroom, students lack the personalized support they need. While teachers may still be available for assistance, digital communication lacks the same level of discussion as face-to-face instruction. Additionally, there is no real opportunity for students to voice their opinions and engage in interactive learning, which is essential for growth. 

Second, learning from home can be difficult for some students. Since there is no one monitoring their progress, many may struggle to focus. Students may become distracted by technology, video games, friends and family, and other out-of-school activities. This results in a lack of progress in classes and can set students back in terms of learning. 

Lastly, at-home learning can lead to a loss in general knowledge and awareness of the world around them. Schools can provide valuable life experiences and necessary social interaction that help prepare students for life beyond the classroom. Without physical classes, students miss out on these experiences, leaving them ill-equipped for the world at large. 

In conclusion, home learning has potential advantages such as convenience and accessibility, however these benefits may come at the cost of personal support, focus, and awareness. Without face-to-face instruction in the classroom, students may not have the skills they need to succeed.",AI

In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. 

The exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.

Another way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves. 

Technology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.",AI

One of the biggest struggles adolescents face is the feeling of being overwhelmed by their environment and the pressures placed upon them. With so many demands placed on young people, it can be difficult to know how to make their own decisions. However, despite these external influences, the power to decide one’s own future and path remains within each person’s control. 

Take for example, the story of Daisy, a high school freshman who felt pressured to pursue a career in medicine, like many of her peers. Despite this, Daisy followed her true passions and decided to major in music instead. While she was aware that this could be a risky endeavor, Daisy chose to take a leap and make the decision that was right for her. Through her strength and courage, Daisy followed her own path and ultimately created the future she wanted for herself. 

These types of stories are reminders that we all have the ability to control our own lives. While we cannot always change our environment or the people around us, the power of decision is in our own hands. No matter what outside influences come our way, it is ultimately our responsibility to make decisions that will help shape the future we want. ",AI

Technology has been both a blessing and a curse when it comes to humans. On one hand, it has allowed us to be more connected than ever before, with people around the world able to communicate quickly and easily. It has also enabled us to access vast amounts of knowledge, with just a few clicks of the mouse. In many ways, technology has made our lives easier and more convenient. 

On the other hand, technology has had some negative consequences. Studies have shown that too much time spent using technology can have a serious impact on our mental and physical health. For example, being constantly exposed to screens can lead to eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and poor posture. Additionally, some technologies have caused problems such as cyberbullying and data breaches, resulting in safety and security risks. 

Ultimately, the key to avoiding the potential negative effects of technology on humans is to use it in moderation. By limiting how much time we spend using these devices, we can reap the benefits of being connected without sacrificing our health or security.",AI

The key to effectively changing one's first impression is to have a deep understanding of the power of cognitive ability. A person's mental capacity for managing the impressions they make on other people is known as ""Impression Management"" and is a skill that can be utilized to craft meaningful conversations that are designed to leave a strong, positive, lasting impression. Impression management techniques such as being mindful of body language and eye contact, speaking slowly and confidently, and being genuinely interested in what your conversation partner has to say can all contribute to making a positive impression.

When it comes tocharting a successful path in life, having a positive attitude is one of the most important tools you can possess. Research has shown that the power of positivity can help propel a person towards their goals and allow them to lead a happier and more meaningful life. Having a positive outlook not only helps increase motivation, but it can also help us to handle difficult situations more effectively and look for solutions rather than dwell on the negatives. On the other hand, not having a positive attitude can cause us to doubt ourselves, become discouraged more easily, and limit our capacity to see solutions. 

Therefore, it is important to recognize the indicators of a negative attitude, such as feeling discouraged or pessimistic, and develop strategies to reverse it. Examples of how a positive attitude can be beneficial in difficult situations include learning how to stay calm, looking for opportunities in adversity, and using positive language. Additionally, in order to achieve goals, it is important to focus on the overall goal rather than on small failures along the way, and to maintain a mindset that is open to learning and is driven by enthusiasm.  With a positive attitude and continued dedication, many seemingly impossible goals can be achieved.",AI

One potential benefit of a 3-year high school program is that it allows students to complete their high school education at a faster pace. This would allow students to finish their education by the age of 18, instead of having to wait until they are 21 or 22 years old. Additionally, the courses offered through a 3-year program are typically more rigorous, so students that graduate from these programs are more prepared for college or post-secondary institutions. 

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to enrolling in a 3-year accelerated program. For example, some students may find it too challenging to keep up with the workload or may find their social life suffering due to the added hours spent studying. Additionally, due to the accelerated nature of the program, the dropout rate may be higher than for traditional 4-year programs. 

In my opinion, 3-year high school programs can be beneficial for certain students, particularly those who are highly motivated and are confident they can handle the increased workload. However, these programs may not be suitable for students who may struggle with the extra pressure or need the extra time to develop both academically and socially.",AI

Self-reliance is defined as the ability to rely on one's own resources and decisions, rather than relying on someone else for advice or help. Being self-reliant has many benefits, which Michael Jordan well-summarized in his quote: ""I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying."" Making one's own decisions is important in order to learn from our mistakes, become self-aware, and make mindful choices. There are advantages and disadvantages to relying on someone else for advice; while it may help to receive input from those who have more experience, it is ultimately best to make decisions based on one's own intuition and knowledge in order to take control of one's own life. Being self-reliant is an invaluable skill to possess, as it allows an individual to make mindful decisions and develop trust in their own decision-making capabilities.",AI

Being honest in relationships and in the real world is an important part of living a healthy, fulfilling life. Although it can sometimes be difficult to tell the truth, it ultimately strengthens relationships, builds trust, and promotes better communication. Honesty leads to greater transparency between two people and allows them to better understand one another.

On the other hand, dishonesty can have devastating effects on relationships. It can lead to hurt feelings, a lack of trust, and even the ending of a relationship. People lie for various reasons, but in the end, dishonesty rarely serves the interests of the one lying. It breeds suspicion and can cause significant damage to a relationship.

In the real world, dishonesty can have serious consequences, ranging from minor penalties to criminal charges. It is ultimately in our best interests to be honest in our dealings with people in order to build credibility and goodwill. Being honest also helps us to avoid unnecessary complications and helps foster a positive image of ourselves.",AI

Online learning has revolutionized the way people learn in the modern world. Despite the availability of advantages, there are also numerous disadvantages that should be considered when enrolling in an online learning program.

One disadvantage of online learning stems from the lack of in-person interaction with instructors. This can be difficult for students who need personal guidance from a teacher to understand complicated concepts. Additionally, when learning online, students may find it more difficult to stay focused on the task at hand. The distractions of home, such as pets, family, or the Internet, can make it hard to concentrate and achieve the same level of understanding that in-person learning might provide.

Another drawback of online learning is the potential for technical issues. In an online course, technology is vital to allow for navigation of course materials, assignments, testing, and communication with instructors and other students. Without access to a reliable internet connection, or even a laptop, it can be difficult for students to complete their work in a timely manner. Additionally, software or unanticipated technical problems can prevent students from accessing their materials, leading to difficulties in completing coursework.

Despite these disadvantages, there are many benefits to online learning. Online courses can provide flexibility to accommodate students’ schedules, allowing them to work around jobs, family commitments, or any other conflicts. It is also possible for students to pursue courses that may not be offered in the traditional college setting, by accessing classes from different college or universities around the world. Additionally, online learning programs are often more affordable than traditional on-campus courses.

In conclusion, online learning offers a range of advantages and disadvantages. When considering online coursework, students should weigh both the positives and negatives in order to make an informed decision on the best learning option for their particular situation.",AI

Distance learning provides students with many benefits compared to traditional classes. One key advantage is that students can attend classes on their own time. With distance learning, no matter where a student is or when they are available, they can attend and complete their courses. This makes it easier for students who for various reasons cannot attend physical classes on time, or who are unable to attend every day.

Also, when a student opts for distance learning, they can attend classes from anywhere. No longer do students have to be cooped up in a traditional classroom; now they can choose to study from the comfort of their own home, or even from a cafe or library in their hometown. This makes learning more convenient and accessible to a variety of students.",AI

Graduating high school early in three or four years has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, graduating early allows students to save on the cost of tuition that would have been used in the remaining year or two of high school. This expedited education can potentially also offer educational benefits such as providing extra time to pursue college courses or internships to gain valuable experience. Additionally, students may benefit from social connections since they will not need to separate from their current circle of friends and family members. 

On the other hand, graduating early may have disadvantages. For example, students may miss out on important educational experiences such as opportunities to learn from teachers or classmates in the later years of high school. Furthermore, there may be financial costs associated with the accelerated pace of education such as the cost of college courses. Additionally, it may be difficult to adjust quickly to the transition into college, and students may thus miss out on the academic preparation they would have gained if they had taken the time to thoroughly complete high school.

Graduating from high school in three years can be an attractive option for certain students looking to jumpstart their education or careers. It may allow them to enter the workforce earlier, potentially providing more job prospects or enhancing the ability to get into top colleges. However, completing high school in such a short period of time also has its drawbacks. There are various challenges to consider such as having to forego certain extracurricular activities and making sure the necessary academic criteria is met. 

For example, a student who wishes to graduate early may need to double up on certain classes or even sacrifice certain electives. This could limit their exposure to different fields of study and potentially reduce their future college options. Furthermore, the intense workload demanded by an accelerated graduation schedule can lead to greater levels of stress which can take its toll on a student both mentally and physically.

Overall, graduating from high school in three years can be beneficial in a variety of ways, but it's important to weigh all the necessary requirements and possible drawbacks. It can be a great option for some students, but it's important to consider the long-term effects that it could have on their studies and future career.",AI

The world is in dire need of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy can help reduce emissions and tackle global warming. With solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass energy, it is possible to phase out fossil fuels entirely and become completely dependent on renewable energy for electricity and transportation. 

One major argument in favor of renewable energy stems from its clean energy production. Fossil fuels create polluting by-products that damage the environment and human health, but renewable energy produces no such pollution. Solar power, for instance, produces no emissions and its use in electric power plants doesn’t require water for cooling. This is critical because many areas of the world are experiencing water shortages. Wind energy is also an extremely clean source of energy, and both solar and wind energy have much lower carbon footprints than fossil fuels. 

In addition to being clean, renewable energy sources are also affordable and have become increasingly so. Solar energy is now about as cheap as energy from fossil fuels, and in some parts of the world, it is even cheaper. Wind power is also much cheaper than solar power and is now competitive with natural gas. By investing in renewable energy sources, governments and businesses can reduce their energy costs in the long run. 

Finally, renewable energy sources offer numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits. For instance, renewable energy is often “distributed” or generated at the point of use, creating jobs in rural and less developed areas. It can also help countries increase their energy security, because they don’t rely on foreign energy sources so much. On the environmental side, renewable energy sources help mitigate climate change, reduce air pollution, and decrease the extraction of finite fossil fuels like coal and oil. 

In conclusion, renewable energy sources are clean, affordable, and offer numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits. For these reasons, it should be the priority of governments and businesses to invest in renewable energy sources in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create more sustainable forms of energy.",AI

Imagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.

Take the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.

On the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.

In summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.",AI

Making a good first impression is incredibly important for many aspects of life. People are often judged by those around them on first impression, and those impressions are lasting. It is not possible to “go back in time” and change a bad first impression; therefore, it is critical that people make sure to leave a positive and lasting impression the first time around. 

Not creating a successful first impression can mean losing important opportunities in life. For example, let’s say an individual is meeting a potential business partner or investor for the first time. If that person neglects to dress for the occasion, appearing unprofessional and unprepared, that could be a deal breaker in terms of convincing the other person to invest in the business. Not appearing to be someone of value and positive standing can quickly result in the loss of a lucrative opportunity. 

Not only does a bad first impression lead to missed opportunity, but it can also lead to getting into serious trouble. Let’s say someone makes a first impression of being lazy and uninterested in a job. That could be grounds for termination if the person is not able to make a sufficient case for themselves in the future. People need to be aware that bad first impressions can have serious consequences, even if they think they can work their way out of the initial poor opinion later. 

In conclusion, making a good first impression is essential. People cannot go back and change a poor first impression, so it is key to make sure to leave a strong and positive one the first time. Neglecting to create a successful first impression can lead to major missed opportunities, or even worse, trouble further down the line.",AI

It is widely accepted that both physical and online learning in the classroom setting have their own advantages and disadvantages. Physical learning gives students the opportunity to actively engage in classroom discussions, form relationships, collaborate, and foster strong connections with their peers and teachers. On the other hand, online learning allows students to access a wider range of materials and resources and is often more convenient for students with difficulty attending traditional classes. 

When comparing the pros and cons of traditional classroom learning and distance learning, both have strengths and drawbacks. Traditional classroom learning allows for a hands-on approach and face-to-face student interaction, while distance learning allows for more independence and tailor-made learning programs. However, distance learning can also be hindered by technological issues and students may feel isolated from their peers. 

The potential difficulties faced with online or video conferencing may include difficulty connecting, slow connection speeds, difficulties using the necessary programs, and additional time needed for preparation. Solutions include planning ahead, using video conferencing tools designed for instruction, testing tools ahead of time, and scheduling regular check-ins with students.

Listening to different opinions is essential for approaching issues objectively and avoiding bias. Instead of automatically assuming that one’s preexisting thoughts are correct, hearing other perspectives allows for critical thought and the formation of more rounded opinions. By taking the time to consider the variety of ideas that are out there, we give ourselves the opportunity to make more informed decisions. Constructive criticism can be a powerful tool when evaluating someone’s suggestion. An open dialogue can further develop someone’s ideas, as well as enhance the discussion by providing further insight.

Attending school and learning from home have both their benefits and disadvantages for students studying history and other required school subjects. In terms of GPA, attending school provides students with more access to in-person resources such as tutoring and other forms of academic help from teachers or fellow students. Furthermore, with the guidance of multiple teachers, students can more easily get a better understanding of the material or ask questions. On the other hand, taking classes from home may have effects on college prospects, as remote learning does not offer students physical mentorship and networking opportunities. 

Although learning from home may limit future college prospects, for some students it may actually expand them. Real-world examples such as the ability to live in a college and work while attending do exist, and this approach can be beneficial for a student trying to balance multiple responsibilities or who prefers a flexible learning schedule. By taking classes remotely, a student might gain the opportunity to hold a job, whereas if they were in a physical classroom, they might be too restricted.

When considering the student view, learning from home can have a greater impact on mental health. For those easily distracted by the presence of others, home learning can be less stressful. In addition, attending physical classes requires more preparedness, as well as having to wear a mask and adhere to other protocols depending on the area. However, attending school is also important for developing study habits and discipline.

When looking at both the pros and cons, the approach which is more beneficial for learning history and other required school subjects might ultimately depend on the students themselves and the situation.

Character traits are essential components of our personalities and identity. Many of us believe that these traits can be changed and altered based on our decisions and choices. But is this something that is within our control? In this essay, I will discuss the idea that we can choose our character traits, and explore whether we can exercise discretion over traits such as being quiet, being social, and being over oneself. 

To begin, let's consider the role of choice in determining personality traits. It's certainly possible for us to choose to be quiet in certain social settings, or to be more social in other settings. In this way, our level of sociability can be determined by our choice in the moment. Similarly, a person can choose to focus on themselves and their own wellbeing rather than serve the needs of others. Although not every person will make the same decision, these kinds of choices are made by many individuals in different situations.

Moreover, researchers have found that even seemingly unchangeable traits, such as extroversion and introversion, can be taken on through conscious effort over time. For example, an introverted person can choose to become more extroverted by making small changes to their behavior and gradually expanding their social circle. Likewise, an extroverted person can choose to become more introverted by limiting their social engagements and doing more activities alone. In this way, our character traits are not necessarily predetermined by our genetic makeup, but can be altered through a combination of conscious effort and personal choice. 

In conclusion, it is possible to choose our character traits, and although the changes may take some time, they are definitely within our control. Whether we choose to be quiet or social, or to focus on ourselves or others, it is all determined by the choices we make. In doing so, we also have the power to shape our identities according to the character traits we choose.",AI

Winston Churchill's statement, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is one that resonates with many, as it eloquently boils down the mindset of a successful and inspiring individual. It is a reminder that, after failure, one must remain passionate and determined in order to see success in the end. Churchill himself embodied this phrase throughout his life, highlighted by his long and varied career in public service. 

For example, Churchill's political career was fraught with several failure, most notably his losing the 1945 general election despite his tremendous effort in leading the country during World War II. Although his party was soundly defeated, Churchill did not lose his enthusiasm and instead chose to continue fighting for the causes he believed in. His resilience in these moments of failure, such as sticking to his guns when delivering his iconic ironic proverb in the middle ofpolitcal chaos, is a testament to his ability to stay motivated despite trying times. 

In addition to his politics, Churchill's record-breaking writing career was filled with hurdles. Despite battling depression and bouts of writer's block, Churchill never lost his enthusiasm for writing and continued to persevere until he completed his impressive body of work. His ability to continue in the face of adversity is an example of Churchill's embodiment of his own famous phrase and reinforces the notion of success stemming from the persistence of enthusiasm. 

Ultimately, Winston Churchill's statement, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is a reminder that the essence of success lies not in avoiding failure, but in staying dedicated and passionate whenever it occurs. Churchill's own experiences in politics and writing demonstrate that remaining enthusiastic and resilient in the face of adversity is truly the driving force behind success.",AI

Recent studies suggest that separating children from their relatives in an effort to diminish their tendency to perform evil acts is an ineffective approach. While it may send the message that the children's actions have significant consequences, it usually results in further disconnection and isolation rather than long-term behavioral changes. 

Other approaches such as conflict resolution training and restorative justice show far greater promise in helping children recognize their mistakes and resolve conflicts without resorting to harmful behaviors. Conflict resolution training teaches children how to recognize, express, and resolve feelings, while restorative justice allows them to reconcile with the people they've hurt and take responsibility for their actions.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to curbing evil behavior in children, there is evidence to suggest that conflict resolution and restorative justice are some of the most effective methods available. These strategies create an environment of understanding and communication, encouraging children to work through their problems and build better relationships.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American philosopher renowned for his writings on individualism and self-reliance. He believed that personal growth and development could only take place when individuals take responsibility for their own lives and eschew conformity to societal norms. This philosophy can be applied to mastering any skill or trying something new. It encourages us to take ownership of our own development, symbolically “take the helm” of our own lives, and stay the course of relentless self-improvement. In today’s world, Emerson’s philosophy is just as relevant as ever. In an era of 24/7 connectivity and distractions, it is harder than ever to stay focused and determined when trying something new or mastering a skill. Emerson’s idea of self-reliance provides foundation for anyone to stay steadfast and committed to their path and personal growth.",AI

When faced with an important decision, it is often beneficial to seek advice from a variety of sources, including experts, friends, and even family. Having an outside perspective can be beneficial in gaining insight, providing understanding, and finding a creative solution that serves the best interests of all involved. It is especially important to be humble and open-minded when seeking advice, allowing others’ points of view to contribute to the decision-making process. 

It can be tempting to rely solely on instinct and only listen to one’s own ideas, but doing so can often lead to the wrong decision and can even have negative consequences. Seeking the help of an experienced expert can be much more effective in providing an investment of time and resources that activates support with fewer potential risks. Experts have the insight and knowledge necessary to provide guidance and concise solutions without taking matters into one’s own hands. 

In any case, when exploring options and seeking advice, it is important to take the time to reach out to various sources for feedback, making sure to take the time to understand each opinion fully before making any big decisions. Additionally, it is vital to research and look for trustworthy sources in order to ensure that the advice received is reliable. Doing so can be a great first step in gaining valuable advice and support when faced with important decisions.",AI

Making important life decisions can be overwhelming. Learning to ask for advice or help can be invaluable when making decisions. Prior generations can provide valuable insights and wisdom, while family members can both support and supply guidance. Having confidence in our own decisions can be challenging but is essential in order to move forward. 

I personally experienced the importance of asking for help when deciding between two job offers. I was uncertain which was best, but after speaking to an older colleague I found the confidence to trust my own judgement. It was comforting to have a knowledgeable person provide their perspective. Additionally, an episode of the television show ""Black-ish"" explored the importance of family support and dialogue when making difficult decisions. In the episode, the protagonist struggles to choose between two career paths and ultimately relies on family members to provide guidance. 

In the political realm, President Obama discussed the importance of asking for help when making decisions. Obama referenced this when he told a story about his mother's life, and how she leaned on her community for support when making important choices. By speaking to family members and friends, Obama's mother had the guidance needed to make the right decisions. 

These examples all demonstrate how critically important it is to ask for help and guidance when making important life decisions. Whether the advice comes from prior generations, family members, or other trusted confidants, having the support surrounding us helps us have the confidence to make the right choice.",AI

As any student can attest, the value of knowledge is immense. Knowledge increases our understanding of the world and our ability to navigate it. However, for me, imagination has proven to be even more valuable. It provides an invaluable resource when seeking to understand something or solve a problem.

Take reading books for example. While knowledge has helped me to reiterate factual information about a certain subject, it doesn't always provide insight into more complex ideas or provide a deeper level of understanding. It is only through imagination that I can truly engage and explore an idea. It is my imagination that helps me to open up possibilities, to connect ideas, to think outside the box, and to see the bigger picture or benefit. 

This same benefit of imagination carries over to my studies and learning. When going over a particularly difficult subject, I often find myself drawing upon my imagination for inspiration. Taking a step back and looking at the assignment in a new light or in a different way can often lead me down some interesting paths that I would have otherwise missed. Imagination opens up the ability to apply the knowledge I have acquired in creative and innovative ways.

The power of imagination cannot be overstated. It is the force that guides our learning process and allows us to form meaningful relationships with the material we are studying. Imagination allows us to go beyond the facts and move into understanding. That is why I believe that imagination is far more important than knowledge.",AI

Being true to oneself in today's world can be difficult, but it can also be very rewarding. On the one hand, society has a lot of pressures and expectations placed upon us, which can make it difficult to stay true to our values and beliefs. On the other hand, remaining true to ourselves can be incredibly liberating. It allows us to stand out from the crowd, to be seen and heard, and to express who we truly are.

The primary advantage of being true to ourselves is that we can make sure our choices are based on our own values and beliefs. We can take pride in our authentic selves, rather than being a clone of what society expects us to be. This can increase our self-esteem and strengthen our confidence, allowing us to face life with more courage and positivity.

The primary disadvantage of being true to oneself is that it means going against the grain. We may face criticism or disapproval from others, or be excluded from certain social circles. We can become a target for bullying or mockery if we express our opinions openly and honestly. Additionally, it can be difficult to remain true to ourselves when faced with peer pressure or when around people who don’t have the same values.

Overall, being true to oneself in a world trying to make us someone else can be a challenging yet rewarding journey. Our authenticity is ours and ours alone – something that no one else can take away from us. Having the strength to stand against the tide and remain true to ourselves can be the greatest victory of all.",AI

Online classes are a great benefit to students who are balancing a career, family commitments, and those living in remote locations. Students with jobs are able to take classes around their schedules without the need to travel to a campus, making it easier for them to finish a degree. Students with family commitments have the flexibility to move at their own pace, completing classes around their existing schedule. Online classes also benefit those living in remote areas, since they can access courses they may not have access to otherwise.

Summer break in many countries is a much-needed time of rest and relaxation for students and educators alike. For many people, this break acts not just as a chance to take a breather, but a catalyst to explore new ideas, cultures, and opportunities. Shortening the summer break would be a disservice to students, particularly those coming from a different country, or those in an education system with short or no winter and spring breaks. 

One common issue among students from different countries is the lack of a traditional “summer holiday.” In many countries, students work longer hours during the summer months and are not able to enjoy the freedom and relaxation of a summer break. On the other hand, those who have the luxury of summer break often make time to explore other cultures, visit new places, and pursue interests that are not possible during the school year. All of these experiences contribute to a learning experience that is valuable in its own right, and cutting short summer break would severely limit these experiences for students from different countries. 

For those in an education system with short or no winter and spring breaks, the summer serves as both a time of rest and renewal. Without these additional breaks, students are more likely to suffer from burnout due to the constant pressure of learning and academic expectations. A long summer break allows students to take a step back and relax, enabling them to re-enter the school year feeling refreshed and ready to learn. 

In conclusion, summer break should not be shortened. It is an important opportunity for students from different countries as well as those within the education system who experience short or no winter and spring breaks. A shortened summer break would not only be detrimental to students' physical and mental health but would deprive them of invaluable experiences that come from exploring different cultures and places.",AI

Implementing a policy where any student receiving a grade of less than a C in class would be excluded from participating in school activities could have several benefits for students and teachers alike. For students, such a policy might provide an incentive to take their studies more seriously as there would be direct and immediate consequences for below-average grades. Additionally, it could offer a structure that encourages scholastic success, since those students who are motivated to achieve higher grades would be rewarded with chances to participate in school activities. 

For teachers, this policy could mean lower stress levels and a more productive learning environment. Not only would the teacher be able to focus on quality instruction rather than attempting to encourage a struggling student, but the other students would also be more engaged in their learning, encouraged by the absence of any disruption caused by a student with below-average grades.

Ultimately, by communicating the consequences of underperforming in their classes, a policy like this could be an effective tool for improving both student performance and overall school environment.",AI

Currently, the majority of public and private schools in the United States follow a traditional scholastic structure that follows a set daily schedule, usually lasting from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The implications of this school schedule include stress on students, an overly-academic curriculum, and limited availability for extracurricular activities. 

The idea of implementing an extended school day is an attractive but often negative prospect, as it could lead to fatigue and decreased enthusiasm for learning, as well as an overall decrease in academic performance. An extended school day could also create incompatibilities for both students and related individuals, such as parents, guardians, or teachers. 

While an extended school day may come with some potential benefits, such as increased academic opportunities, improved communication outreach and a more flexible curricular structure, there are potential problems associated with it that must be considered. Parents, guardians, and teachers would all have to adjust their schedules in order to accommodate a longer school day, which could create a strain due to the need for additional childcare options. Additionally, an extended school day could lead to an increase in stress and anxiety for students as they struggle to find balance between their academic and social lives.",AI

The benefits of taking music, drama, and art classes for students should not be underestimated. These activities can not only give young people the opportunity to express their creativity, but can also help to sustain their mental health. For instance, music can act as a form of mindfulness and provide an essential outlet for stress relief. Drama classes can also offer invaluable opportunities to practice interpersonal communication skills such as public speaking, as well as giving students an opportunity to build confidence and find their own creative voice. 

However, it is also important to touch upon the potential drawbacks to taking music, drama, and arts classes. For instance, these activities can be time-consuming and can take away from time that students could have spent on schoolwork. Furthermore, there is often an intimidating element that comes with these types of performances; having an audience can be difficult for some students, especially those who are more introverted. 

Importantly, parental support plays a critical role in the success of taking these activities. Without encouragement from their parents to try new things and promote confidence, students may not have the confidence to try out these activities or feel comfortable enough to do so. Encouragement from parents can make the whole experience less stressful and more enjoyable overall. Examples of this could include providing support when students are preparing for an upcoming performance or class.  Additionally, parents can attend classes and shows with their children to celebrate their successes.  Ultimately, having this type of parental support is essential for students in these activities.",AI

Metaphor is a comparison of two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as."" An example of metaphor is, ""His whispered words were a soothing balm."" Personification is the giving of human qualities to non-humans. An example of personification is, ""The wind howled in despair."" All of these techniques are used to create emotion and imagery.

In today's world, oftentimes the greatest gift we can give another person is a simple act of kindness. Whether it's a smile in passing, a word of encouragement, or a friendly gesture, any act of kindness has the potential to have a high impact on someone's life. 

For starters, research has shown that an act of kindness has a ripple effect of its own. A single action can cause a chain of reactions that spread outward, positively affecting the lives of multiple people. If we look at the example of a coach who takes the time to mentor a younger person, that coach's act of kindness can not only have a positive effect on the life of the child, but also the child's family, community, and beyond. 

Moreover, an act of kindness can also act as a source of inspiration. When one person performs an act of kindness, it has the potential to motivate others to act similarly. It is possible that the kindness one person shows can have a far reaching effect and encourage people to improve the lives of those around them. 

However, perhaps most importantly, an act of kindness can have a tremendous impact on someone’s self-esteem and mental health. By showing someone that they are important and valued, it can have a profound effect on how that person values and views themself. An act of kindness can provide hope and comfort to someone who might be in need. 

Ultimately, acts of kindness can bring incredible positivity to both those who perform them and those who receive them. Whether it's a small gesture or a larger commitment, any act of kindness has the capacity to dramatically improve someone's life.",AI

When I was in high school, I had a difficult time staying on top of my homework. I struggled to find motivation to finish my assignments and often faced the consequences of not turning them in on time. Working with a group of other students in an after-school homework club would have been a great advantage for me.

Having peers around to help each other with difficult assignments, ask questions, and provide support would have made it easier for me to not only finish my assignments on time, but even to finish them early. Furthermore, by working collaboratively with others on the same material, I would have gained a deeper understanding of the material and, in turn, a better grade.

In addition to improving student performance, joining a homework club can help students sharpen their communication skills. It teaches students to work together, reach compromises with other people’s ideas, and better articulate and defend their own thoughts and opinions. Working on projects together to finish assignments can help students learn how to cooperate socially and academically.

In conclusion, an after-school homework club is a great resource for students looking to improve their grades, deepen their understanding of the material, and sharpen their communication skills. It can ease the burden of completing assignments and provide an encouraging and helpful environment that can facilitate learning and collaboration.",AI

On my first day working at my uncle’s marble shop, I was filled with a sense of awe and excitement. With both admiration and fear, I glanced around at the beautiful slabs of marble that seemed to come in every hue imaginable. Knowing that I had the opportunity to work with and learn from my uncle made me feel a unique combination of anticipation and trepidation. 

When I made my first mistake, my uncertainty and doubt grew exponentially. I thought that I had failed my uncle and I felt embarrassed and ashamed. I didn’t think that I had the skills or experience necessary to do the job. However, my uncle quickly put my worries to rest by reassuring and encouraging me, and trusting me to try again. 

Through this experience, I learned that missteps should not be feared. I left my uncle’s marble shop with a sense of accomplishment and pride knowing that I could persevere and overcome any challenge. My uncle’s guidance reaffirmed a deep, underlying truth that I have carried with me since: we all make mistakes, and we can always learn from them if we stay open and positive. Working with him at the marble shop opened me up to a world of knowledge and understanding, and taught me about the importance of resilience and growth.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."" This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally. 

One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success. 

Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals. 

Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.",AI

Bullying is a widespread problem in today's society and is a major contributor to the psychological distress of many individuals. People may resort to bullying because they are seeking validation, feel insecure, or are trying to cope with their own sense of powerlessness. Unfortunately, the consequences of bullying can be severe. Those who bully can suffer from depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and feelings of guilt. Additionally, in some states, bullying can be punishable by law. To best address the issue of bullying, it is imperative that we work to create communities that foster understanding and acceptance. This can involve providing support for those who bully, educating people on the consequences of bullying, and encouraging open dialogue about the issue. We must also learn to recognize and respect the human dignity of all individuals, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, class, or any other difference. Only by recognizing the value of every individual can we strive to cultivate a more equitable society and to combat the bullying that so often threatens our sense of safety and security.",AI

As the pressure to succeed increases, the role of praise in educational settings has become more prominent. A recent study investigated how praising student's deficient work affects their self-esteem, learning standards, and their likelihood of graduating high school. The study included 200 students from multiple high schools across the country and monitored their responses to praise and criticism. The findings showed that students who were praised for work that was below expectations had better self-esteem, higher academic standards, and were more likely to graduate high school than those who received criticism. This provides evidence that praising student's deficient work can have a positive effect on their development. It follows then that providing appropriate praise which encourages and motivates students should be incorporated into educational curriculums.",AI

One of the main times it may not be beneficial to show kindness is when a person is the victim of bullying. Rather than just standing by and being kind, in this situation, one might consider voicing their opinion in defense of the person being bullied and more actively standing up for them. This can have negative consequences, however, as it is unlikely the bully will view this as an act of kindness. The bully and their friends may see this as a challenge to their authority, and they might react negatively. In addition, one must use their best judgement to decide if a situation requires kindness or discipline. Sometimes, it may be best to be kind and forgive someone's misbehavior, while in other cases, it is better to be firm and demand respect for yourself and those around you. In some cases, it is truly not beneficial to show kindness to people who do not deserve it, as this can often be taken for granted and lead to more trouble in the long run.",AI

School districts across the country are now offering shorter pathways for high school students, allowing them to graduate in three instead of four years. This ambitious proposal, while it has its drawbacks, is not without its benefits. Those who complete the three-year program can achieve financial independence earlier by starting their career or college sooner, and have more time to acquire valuable life experience during the duration of their studies.

The primary concern of such accelerated programs is that students may not have enough time to truly devote to their studies, and could be overwhelmed by heavy course loads and a truncated timeline. In order to ensure students are retaining their education, some school districts may have to reduce the number of extracurricular activities and limit certain subjects, such as science or foreign language. 

While there will always be pros and cons associated with any program, the potential benefits of offering shorter pathways for high school students cannot be ignored. By pursuing such accelerated studies, students can work towards financial independence, receive the life experience they need for career or college success, and further their education with more opportunities for advanced training.",AI

Thomas Jefferson once famously declared that “nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude"". His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. 

When examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design.

In contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. 

In conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. Achieving one’s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great.",AI

No matter who you are, it is important to accomplish something in life. Whether it is achieving a goal, taking on a challenge, or breaking an old habit, setting goals and accomplishing them is essential. Achieving your goals can help you improve yourself, and provide a sense of satisfaction and pride. For instance, if you set a goal to get in shape, working out consistently and seeing results will give you a sense of accomplishment. Also, if you take on a challenge, like learning a new language, you feel more confident in your abilities. 

Another reason to accomplish something in life is to avoid boredom. Too often, people find themselves repeating daily routines, with no excitement or enthusiasm. By setting goals and challenging yourself, you can stay motivated and interested, and experience new levels of fun and energy. For example, if you like to play video games, you might challenge yourself to beat a new game or break a personal score. This will give you a greater sense of enjoyment when playing, as well as providing a sense of accomplishment. 

Finally, accomplishing something is a great way to gain pride in one's accomplishments. When you achieve something, you can look back and be proud of yourself. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small. For example, if you set a goal to save money, do something meaningful when you reach it, such as going out for dinner with friends or treating yourself to something special. Being proud of your accomplishments will only build up your resilience and confidence, and make you more likely to push yourself to achieve more. 

In conclusion, there are numerous reasons to accomplish something in life.

Many students struggle to decide on a career path at a young age. Some may feel like there’s too much pressure to decide, while others may be overwhelmed by the wide range of options available. In any case, there are both pros and cons to committing to a career at a young age.

On the plus side, committing to a career at a young age gives one time to plan, strategize, and prepare for the future. Having a clear end goal in mind can help generate focus and motivate one to stay on track with progress. For instance, if a student commits to becoming a doctor, they may take advanced math and science classes in high school to get a jump start on their future medical training.

On the flip side, committing to a career at a young age can limit one’s options and opportunities. It may be that the young student’s interests and aptitudes change, and that the career they had decided on is no longer the best fit. For instance, if a student had wanted to become a dentist, but discovers a passion for architecture afterwards, there can be a significant amount of disruption and setback for their pre-planned career path.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can be a great way to help prepare for the future, but it’s important to have the flexibility to alter one’s plans if interests and aptitudes change. Having a clear vision of future goals, self-awareness of one’s interests and strengths, and a commitment to working hard are all key components to successful career planning.",AI

Maintaining one's individual identity is essential to leading a successful life. People often conform to societal standards, but a commitment to one's own values and beliefs often leads to a greater personal satisfaction and success. Emerson's quote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,"" captures the importance of forging one's own path in order to lead an authentic life.

One example of this is the story of Wilma Rudolph.

Being productive is a powerful tool for achieving success and good health. Through heightened productivity, one is able to actively pursue their goals, often with swiftness, efficiency and effectiveness. As such, many successful individuals throughout history have attributed much of their success partly or entirely to their productivity. Examples include Bill Gates, whose focus on innovation and productivity revolutionized the technology industry; Elon Musk, who applied his productive approach to several industries including space exploration and automobile engineering; and Oprah Winfrey, who used her productive approach to create her own media empire from scratch.

Productivity leads to success and health in three key ways. Firstly, it enables us to make the most of our time by allocating our resources efficiently. This generates more time for rest and leisure, thus providing an opportunity for people to maintain and improve their overall wellbeing. Secondly, pursuing objectives efficiently through productivity can lead to tangible results, such as financial prosperity, which itself leads to better physical and mental health. Lastly, it provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which is often essential for both our physical and psychological well-being.

In conclusion, it can be seen that productivity is a fundamental ingredient for achieving success and good health. By learning how to be productive and organized in our approach, we can keep track of our objectives and goals, make the most of our resources, pursue our dreams and ambitions, and develop a meaningful impact in both our lives and the lives of others. Taking an active and productive approach to life thus provides us with the opportunity to maximize our potential in a wide range of fields while still allowing us to maintain our overall wellbeing.",AI

Taking some free time to relax and break away from a work or school task can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on achieving individual goals. Studies have indicated that, when managed carefully, taking breaks throughout the day can significantly improve productivity for those working in busy environments. Furthermore, workers who take regular breaks tend to remain more engaged in their tasks while having an improved ability to recall and recall information. On the other hand, too much inactivity can lead to decreases in productivity and motivation and can make it more challenging to complete tasks in a given amount of time. 

The importance of effective time management when trying to accomplish a goal cannot be overstated. Planning out a schedule and setting aside designated periods of time to complete tasks can help keep idle time to a minimum and ensure that progress is being made. Having a daily to-do list and breaking tasks up into smaller, more manageable pieces can also help increase overall productivity and allow for more free time during the day. By implementing effective time management strategies, individuals can maximize their potential and reach their fullest potential.",AI

In today's world, it's easy to forget the importance of simply being yourself. We are constantly bombarded with messages and information from society and the media telling us what we should and shouldn't do. As a result, many of us fall into the trap of trying to conform to expectations in order to fit in and be accepted. 

But it is important to remember that being true to yourself is essential for a happy and healthy life. By being yourself, you will have a greater sense of purpose and direction in your life. You are unique – no one else shares the same character traits, life experiences, and views as you. It is your differences that make you unique and special.

When you are comfortable in your own skin, you will also be more likely to take on challenging tasks, explore new opportunities, and communicate your needs and wants with others in an effective way. You will also be more confident in your decisions, and have the courage to pursue your dreams.

At the end of the day, the most important thing is for you to stay true to yourself and do what makes you happy. There are no right or wrong answers in life, and you should not live your life according to anyone else's expectations. By being yourself, you will be able to create a life worth living.",AI

Taking classes online offers students many advantages as opposed to attending physical classes in school. For students who are not fond of attending class in person, online classes provide the benefit of being able to learn from the comfort of their own homes. Students who take online classes can also work at their own pace, since they are not limited to prescribed class times. Furthermore, classes are available on their own schedule and assignments can even be due after midnight, meaning snow days and other external factors that would otherwise cause school closure have no effect. Taking classes online provides students with a convenient option to work with their own schedule and complete work in a more comfortable environment. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that online classes have clear advantages that benefit students in their learning process.",AI

High goals are essential in life and can help lead to success. Having big ambitions allows us to strive for something greater, pushing our limits and growing in the process. Without having high goals, our potential for personal growth and achievement is greatly diminished. 

The importance of having high goals is demonstrated in many successful people’s stories. For example, Oprah Winfrey was determined to become a successful television host despite facing many obstacles in her personal life, and went on to become one of the most successful people in the entertainment industry. Similarly, Steve Jobs’ innovative vision for technology pushed him to create products and services that revolutionized the tech industry. 

On the other hand, taking low goals can prevent us from achieving success. Having lower expectations does not challenge us to push our boundaries or think outside the box. Low goals often can lead to complacency, which in turn can lead to a lack of growth, stagnation, and eventually failure. Without the motivation to strive for something greater, growth and ultimately success become difficult to achieve. 

In conclusion, it is important to have high goals in life as they can help to unlock our true potential and potential for success. Having high goals can also help to keep us motivated and focused, helping to avoid any complacency that might lead to failure. By taking the necessary steps and having a level of ambition to attain these goals, we can set our sights high and reach success.",AI

Studying from home via online videoconferencing is a topic that sparks much debate among students, parents, and educators. The question of whether attending classes from home is a favorable method of study can be seen from various perspectives. 

On one side, differences in the environment between attending classes from home versus attending classes in school can be observed. For example, attending classes from home allows students to have a more comfortable and relaxed setting which often comes with fewer distractions, leading to better focus and concentration. However, it can also be argued that being in a school setting allows students to interact more directly with their peers and instructors, leading to a more effective way of learning. 

In regards to the potential impact on a student's academic performance, attending classes from home with online videoconferencing has both pros and cons. While it provides students with the convenience and flexibility to work at their own pace with the right amount of personal direction from the instructor, it also creates a lack of human interaction and social skills that generally come with attending classes in person.

Overall, there are many factors that contribute to a student's decision to attend classes from home via online videoconferencing. It is also important to consider the influence it can have on a student's social and communication skills as this is an essential part of their education. While attending classes from home can improve focus and provide students with the flexibility to work at their own pace, it cannot replicate the benefits associated with attending classes in person, such as human interaction and social development. Ultimately, it is up to each student to decide what is best for them and how they can benefit from attending classes from home.",AI

Excerpt: 

The great Thomas Jefferson once said, “Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing”. This quote clearly emphasizes the benefits of taking action instead of remaining idle in order to reach future goals. Taking action can not only help in the planning of future goals, but also in achieving and completing them. From setting deadlines to breaking down tasks into smaller objectives, taking action is the key to success. Furthermore, taking action can also help in improving study habits for those who are studying. Whether it is through studying in smaller rounds, setting the time limit for different topics and subjects, or in taking short breaks in-between, working actively is the best approach to studying. On the other hand, staying idle may work for some individuals. However, we need to take into consideration that the results won’t be as great as taking action. Taking action is best when it comes to achieving future goals.",AI

Playing basketball is one of the most enjoyable activities in the world. There are many reasons why people find this sport so enjoyable. One of the major reasons is the addictiveness of the game — playing basketball can be an incredibly rewarding experience. There is a certain amount of satisfaction that comes from making a shot or successfully executing a play. This creates a feeling of accomplishment which can be very rewarding and can make it easy to become hooked on the game. 

Additionally, playing basketball is a great way to stay physically fit. The physical aspect of the game is intense and provides a great way for people to stay active and in shape. Active players can experience improved endurance, agility, balance, and speed, all of which are necessary for the sport. The amount of physical exercise associated with playing basketball can also lead to improved overall health. 

Finally, basketball is also great for staying mentally fit. The game requires a lot of strategic thinking and decision-making. Players must be able to think quickly in order to make the right decisions in the heat of the moment and can benefit greatly from improved problem-solving capabilities. Additionally, basketball can be a great way to take a break from the pressures of everyday life and can provide a great outlet for stress. 

In conclusion, basketball is an incredibly enjoyable sport. It is addictive, keeps players fit physically, and challenges players mentally. All of these qualities add up to make basketball an enjoyable and rewarding activity.",AI

Technology has changed the way we live our lives. From simple labor-reducing items such as washing machines and computers, to revolutionary communication tools like the Internet and smart phones, technology advances have altered the way we experience the world.

One of the most positive impacts of technology is the fact that it facilitates easier and faster communication between people. In the past, the way to find out information about someone or something was to do research; however today, we can find out almost anything we want to know quickly and even communicate with people regardless of distance. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.

Unfortunately, technology also has its downsides. For example, it can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, as people often spend large amounts of time on the computer, instead of going outdoors and exercising. Also, spending too much time on digital devices can result in damage to relationships due to less face-to-face time with family and friends. In addition, technology is creating a world of instant gratification, which can lead to feelings of impatience with the non-digital world and can lead to a decrease in motivation and self-regulation.

Overall, technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives. It enables us to work more efficiently and communicate more easily; however, it can also lead to unhealthy habits and an overall decrease in motivation. Therefore, it is important to keep a balance between the two, in order to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote “To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment” is truly meaningful and strikes a chord with many people. In today’s world, one is constantly bombarded with various pressures and expectations, such as achieving certain goals, getting into certain colleges, or succeeding in particular career paths. Although these expectations can be beneficial in pushing individuals to reach their goals, oftentimes, it can be immensely difficult to stand out and remain true to oneself amidst these pressures.

For those who take the initiative to forge their own path and not get trapped by feeling the need to be the same as everyone else, it is a great accomplishment. For example, deciding to pursue an unconventional career path despite the disapproval of family and friends, or exploring a side hustle despite the fear of failure all embody this quote’s sentiment. It is a difficult process, but a rewarding one, and it takes immense strength and courage to be able to resist the urge to conform.

In a way, Emerson’s quote serves as a reminder that one should strive to be the best version of oneself and never lose sight of the unique individual qualities that make oneself special and entire. At the same time, it also serves as a source of celebration for anyone who has gone through their own valiant journey to stay true to themselves and their larger goals in the face of challenges.",AI

Starting a business provides a unique opportunity to become a master of a particular industry. For example, a person who starts a catering business can become a master chef, able to create delicious dishes and efficiently run a successful catering business. Gaining mastery in a specific business area is beneficial in that a person can become an authority in a particular field. 

However, another approach a business owner might take is to take on multiple tasks and grow through experience. For example, a restaurant owner might gain knowledge and experience related to real estate, food sourcing, marketing, and personnel. By taking on roles outside of the core business skills, the restaurant owner can gain knowledge in a variety of areas, knowledge which can in turn lead to more creative and innovative ideas. 

It is important for a business owner to stay on top of knowledge and experiences related to their business in order to remain diverse and competitive. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” In business, it is important to think outside the box, to develop ideas and create solutions that are unique and innovative.

Having a positive attitude is essential for succeeding in life. Attitude is an important charisma as it shapes our actions, outlook and decisions, which consequently affects how our peers and the world around us perceive us. 

In the workplace, attitude is key in order to create and maintain successful professional relationships. Employers value people who have a positive attitude as they are more likely to have better communication skills, open to new ideas and cope better with stress. People in the workplace with a negative attitude can affect morale, job performance and overall company culture. 

School is another area in life where attitude is particularly important, as it can determine how successful a student is. Students with a positive attitude are more likely to be self-confident, organized and motivated individuals, which can be key in helping them reach their goals. Students that are motivated and engaged in activities not only get better grades but also build strong relationships with their teachers, mentors, and peers.

At home, attitude is also important for maintaining relationships with family and friends. Positive attitudes create an atmosphere of trust, understanding and support. It is also important to respond to events in an appropriate negative attitude when needed, so as to set healthy boundaries and foster mutual respect.

In conclusion, attitude is an important charisma for success in life as it impacts our actions, outlook, and decisions.

After school homework clubs provide crucial support for students who may struggle with class work and homework during normal school hours. Aside from providing assistance with homework, these clubs can also help students better understand their language and improve their grades.

Students may need help with their homework or classwork for a variety of reasons, such as not understanding the material, not having enough time during the day to focus, or needing an environment free of distractions. An after school homework club can provide assistance and support for students who are struggling with their studies. It also gives them dedicated time and resources to focus on their studies and helps them understand their course materials better.

For students who are struggling to keep up with their studies or do not understand their language, staying after school can help them improve their grades and understanding. Teachers can support these students by providing them with academic guidance, motivation and rewards for attending the after school homework club. Additionally, teachers can motivate and encourage students to stay after school to do their homework by providing incentives, such as special privileges or rewards for progress made in their studies.

The debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time. However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.

First and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.

In addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support. This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.

Lastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. Teachers dedicate a great deal of time to their work and, by painting it as something that can be accomplished in a short amount of time, we risk giving the impression that it is a less worthy profession worth less than those requiring more working hours.

For these reasons, reducing work hours for school teachers is not a wise decision. While it may provide teachers with greater leisure time, it is important to weigh the implications and maintain the respect and integrity due to the education system.",AI

Distance learning has become an increasingly popular form of education in recent years, providing students of all ages around the world with countless benefits. The cost benefits, access to education, and differing levels of educational assistance are just some of the advantages of distance learning that make it an attractive option. 

For starters, distance learning can be significantly less expensive than traditional education. As more resources and educational materials move online, students have access to a wider array of courses at cheaper prices, and with the convenience of learning from anywhere. As an added bonus, students often have access to courses and universities that would not otherwise be available to them due to location or financial restrictions. 

Another advantage of distance learning is its ability to provide educational opportunities to those who would not otherwise have access. Many students around the world are still unable to access traditional education due to various limitations, but distance learning provides them with the chance to learn and contribute to the global education system without needing to attend a physical campus. 

Finally, distance learning can provide a wide range of educational assistance for students of all ages and backgrounds. This could include additional support for those who require special needs assistance, online tutoring, and guidance on various topics that students may find challenging.

Moreover, adults who read for educational or professional purposes are also likely to improve their knowledge and understanding of the topic. Elderly people who read non-fiction books increase their overall psychological wellbeing and reduce their stress levels.

Playing sports and watching games can both offer different advantages. Playing sports offers the potential for physical exercise, the opportunity to learn and improve skills, and the chance to build meaningful connections with peers.

Influence, both positive and negative, is an unavoidable element of human interaction. Positive influence exists when people are uplifted and encouraged to accomplish goals or achieve desired behaviors; for example, a parent conveying to a child praise or words of support. This can be an invaluable tool in helping individuals develop their potential. Negative influence, meanwhile, can manifest as manipulation, coercion, or in cases of severe power inequity, even physical, mental, or emotional abuse; these can be particularly damaging as people can be coerced into damaging or dangerous behaviors that have both immediate and long-term consequences that can be detrimental to their well-being. 

The impact of influence on people can be far-reaching. Positive influence can provide people with the confidence and motivation to pursue opportunities in life and strive for success. Conversely, negative influence can be incredibly destructive, resulting in patterns of unhealthy behavior, low self-esteem, and disastrous decision-making.

It is often difficult to accurately gauge our own abilities and comparing them with the goals that we set for ourselves. If we set goals that are too difficult, we may become frustrated and unhappy with our position. But if we set goals that are too easy, we may become complacent and never strive for improvement. Setting both easy and hard goals can be beneficial, as it challenges us to continuously work towards personal growth and development. For example, if someone wished to become a professional musician, setting easier goals such as learning chords or chords progressions can provide the necessary foundation while still inspiring them to eventually reach their goal. Setting easy goals can create a scaffolding that will help to eventually create a larger structure. Thus, by setting both easy and hard goals and knowing our limits, we can consistently strive for greater heights.",AI

One of the greatest aspects of the human condition is our capacity for imagination. Without imagination, knowledge is not only static, but limited. Imagination is the driving force behind the advancement of humanity, because without it, progress would be impossible. In our daily life, imagination plays a critical role in every decision we make and every idea we conceive. From selecting the right job to supporting our family, our imagination gives us the capacity to create scenarios and visualize the outcomes of various actions. This ability to creatively explore alternatives allows us to develop informed strategies based on our own inner wisdom. Without our imagination, we would be stuck in an unchangeable world, unable to adapt to the knowledge of the present. Simply put, imagination is a fundamental element of knowledge.  ",AI

Adopting a 10 pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is an important step for ensuring that young people have safe and enjoyable lives. Having fixed times to be home helps to protect teenagers from the dangerous activities that take place after dark, as well as the possibility of more serious criminal behavior. Examples of the types of trouble that can be avoided include theft, drug use, alcohol consumption, and harm to oneself or someone else.

Having a curfew also teaches teens how to manage their time responsibly. It reinforces the idea that there are certain tasks or behaviors that have specific deadlines, such as being ready for school in the morning or doing homework by a given time. Additionally, it serves as an impetus for teenagers to use their free time productively, as many may find themselves wanting to take full advantage of the daylight hours before having to be home. 

Obeying the curfew law is an important step in creating a society in which young people lead safe and respected lives. Firstly, teens will be reducing their risk of involvement in negative activities, providing a sense of safety and security. Secondly, by following the law, teenagers learn the importance of valuing the authority of their parents and elders, as well as understanding the rules of society.

In summation, adopting a 10 pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is an essential step to ensure that young people are cared for and protected. Such a law would help teenagers stay safe, manage their time responsibly, and respect the authority of adults.",AI

In recent years, public school systems have been forced to make difficult decisions regarding the budget allocated to school sports teams. In order to maximize the impact of available resources, many schools are turning to a potential new policy that would provide equal access for all students who wish to participate in sports programs, while recognizing that not all students are competitive athletes.

From the student perspective, the new policy would be advantageous in that it could potentially provide more opportunities to develop communication and teamwork skills, while also teaching the value of healthy competition. Additionally, the policy could increase school participation and engagement among students who are less athletically inclined, thus boosting morale and school spirit.

On the other hand, the policy could place a strain on school budgets due to the need for additional facilities and equipment. Moreover, the policy could also take away from essential resources such as teacher salaries and classroom materials. Teachers may find it difficult to provide equal attention and motivation to all athletes.

Ultimately, the new policy could potentially benefit some schools, resulting in increased school spirit and greater access to sports. However, the disadvantages should be carefully considered before instituting such a policy. ",AI

Educational activities can have both positive and negative outcomes when it comes to learning, socializing, and making friends. On the one hand, participating in educational activities can have a range of benefits. It can develop important communication and team-building skills, promote problem-solving abilities, and foster creativity and critical thinking. In addition, these activities can be a great way to make friends and broaden social networks. 

However, working with a team or group of people can present its own set of challenges. Disagreements and arguments are common, and it can be difficult for everyone to share an opinion without offending someone else. In order to manage these differences, it is important to agree on a few ground rules in advance.

Art classes should not be a requirement for students. Electives provide a more vibrant and diverse learning experience than a mandatory class could, allowing students to explore the topics they are most interested in. By taking electives, students have more freedom to indulge their passions and interests, increasing their enjoyment of the school experience. Furthermore, electives can offer valuable real-world insights, such as career counseling, which prepares them for their future.

Making art classes a requirement would deprive students of creative freedom, which often leads to higher engagement and enthusiasm for the subject. While studying an art form can be rewarding and should be encouraged, forcing it on students may leave them feeling overwhelmed, unmotivated, and detracts from their enjoyment of the school experience. Additionally, making art classes a requirement would limit students' ability to choose other highly educational pre-professional courses which can help them become prepared for the job market. 

In conclusion, electives provide a more diverse, stimulating, and enjoyable learning experience than mandatory art classes.

In recent years, technology has been a great aid to humans in limiting contact with one another, especially during times of change or crisis. Such use has helped to improve physical and mental health for individuals around the globe. As people limit their contact with each other, they limit their exposure to external factors that may disrupt their daily lives. Those who participate in online social networks are capable of maintaining meaningful connections without the need to congregate in person, allowing them to stay safe and secure. 

Technology also allows users to keep up-to-date on world news. Individuals can regularly read about or watch news broadcasts that update them with the most recent information about news and events. This helps them stay informed without having to constantly interact with other people. Furthermore, technology can help create an awareness of how news and events in the world can affect individuals personally, making them more cognizant of their environments.

In my opinion, adding an extra half hour to the school day would not be beneficial for students. Firstly, it would be detrimental to our families. Cut into the already limited time our families have together, an extra half hour of school would be an unnecessary strain. This would affect students of all ages, from kindergarteners who need their parents attention to teenagers balancing work and school - making parenting and family time much more difficult. 

Moreover, an additional half hour would directly interfere with student-athletes’ schedules. Any extra time spent in the classroom would be time away from practices, conditioning, or participating in games. The extra half hour would make it increasingly difficult to not only keep up in school but to also support their team both physically and mentally.

Furthermore, it would be a hassle to quickly squeeze in doctor’s appointments or any other obligations students may have after school. Having just thirty minutes extra wouldn’t be enough time to travel to appointments, so students would have to miss class or find a new doctor song slot.

Finally, it is worth noting that the school day is already long enough. Between student life obligations and homework, students have already committed much of their time to education. Asking for an additional half hour of their day would be taxing, both mentally and physically. 

In conclusion, an extra half hour of school would not be beneficial for students, and I am opposed to the school board making this decision.",AI

The advent of technology has drastically changed the world and the way humans live. In the modern era, it has provided numerous benefits, from improved communication to quick and easy access to information. Through advances in medical technology, diseases can be detected and treated, and lives saved.

However, technology can also have a detrimental effect on the world. Distractions, such as video games and social media, can lead to increased time spent on screens, reducing physical activity and leading to poor physical and mental health. Moreover, problems such as data breaches and identity theft can befall those who are careless with their technology.

It is important to consider how to manage technology responsibly. Individuals should take steps to protect their data, such as ensuring device security settings are enabled.

After reviewing several studies on the pros and cons of requiring students to do community service, it appears that the primary concern is the potential impact on academic performance. The students may be so focused on completing the service requirements that they neglect to focus enough time and energy on their studies. However, community service can also teach valuable life lessons such as compassion, empathy, collaboration, and communication, which can have a positive effect on academic performance.  

A potential solution to this issue would be to allow students to choose the type and amount of community service they take part in. By allowing students to customize their service, they can optimize their time to ensure both their academic and personal needs are met. Additionally, this solution would empower students to serve their community in a way that suits their interests and passions. Finally, the government should provide incentives for students who choose to do community service beyond the required minimum, such as scholarship and volunteer awards.

Changing the school menu can be a controversial topic, as it has both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, it is undeniable that nutrition is important, especially for growing children. Introducing a more varied and balanced menu would offer students the proper assortment of nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, children are more likely to taste new foods when their peers are trying them as well. This could help students be more adventurous eaters, resulting in healthier long-term dietary habits.

On the other hand, there is a risk of unfamiliar foods being met with negative responses. Many students resist change and may be unwilling to try new meals, particularly those which are not part of their culture or personal likes. Furthermore, the cost of introducing higher-quality ingredients may put financial strain on families, especially those whose budgets are already stretched thin. Finally, dining hall staff may need additional training to prepare the food, resulting in additional expenses.

Imagination is a powerful tool that can elevate us beyond the limits of knowledge and what is already known. We may not be able to physically materialize our imaginations in the same way we can facts, but we can use them to explore new ideas that would otherwise be off-limits. We can use imagination to bring joy, to create works of art and entertainment, and to spark innovative thinking that can produce groundbreaking products and inventions.

On a personal level, I have often used imagination to take a deeper look at the world around me. Through imagining what life would be like in different situations and scenarios, I developed a better understanding of various contexts and the implications of the decisions I have made.

 Students should not be required to take classes in arts, music, or drama for a variety of reasons. To begin, these classes often require special resources and materials which can be expensive for parents and schools alike. Additionally, students come from different backgrounds and interests, and should have the freedom to choose the classes which best suit them. While many people believe that such classes can help to develop creativity, this development may be more easily obtained through activities and educational opportunities outside of the classroom. 

Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide how to best spend their time and energy. Forcing students to take arts, music, or drama classes may lead to a lack of engagement or even resentment, and both can be harmful to the learning process.

Online school offers several advantages when compared to traditional, in-person schooling. For example, when attending online classes, students don't have to worry about their clothing and appearance. This means they can work in the comfort of their own home, dressed however they'd like. Along the same lines, students are not subject to the social pressure of their peers when attending online courses.

On the other hand, while online schooling can be more convenient, the workload stress can be detrimental to student success. With traditional school, there is an instructor present to keep students on task, providing an overview of class work expectations. With online schooling, this structure is not always present, meaning it can be difficult for students to stay focused when they don't have the same level of guidance.

Finally, one of the key drawbacks to online school is the lack of extracurricular activities. While traditional school allows for students to participate in events such as plays and team sports, these activities are often more sparsely available in the online realm. This is of course due to the virtual nature of the school setting. Without peers and tangible events to participate in, students run the risk of feeling a lack of community and companionship.",AI

One strategy business are increasingly adopting to conserve energy and resources is to decrease the amount of time spent in the office each week. By implementing a four-day work week, organizations are able to dramatically reduce their energy and resource consumption both directly and indirectly. For example, fewer hours working each week means less electricity used, less fuel consumed for commuting, and fewer resources wasted on stationery and utilities. 

Despite the potential advantages of a four-day working week, some organizations may be cautious about the trade-off between time and energy savings. Similarly, extending the school day by two hours could have a number of consequences. Such a move prevents students from having free-time after school and could lead to an over-scheduling of classes and activities. It can also put a strain on resources such as electricity, water, and paper, reducing the school's ability to conserve energy and resources. 

When it comes to education, there is a clear difference between the energy and resources used when attending school five days per week for eight hours and four days per week for the same amount of time. While the total amount of time spent remains the same, most energy-consuming activities such as heating and air-conditioning are required over a longer period when school is spread out over five days. Additionally, students must use more resources such as fuel to commute back and forth to school five days per week as opposed to four. ",AI

School policies should be designed to encourage students to maximize their potential and strive for success. Requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is not only counterintuitive to this goal, but it can also have a detrimental effect on student morale and motivation. 

Forcing students to maintain a B average in order to participate in extra-curricular activities does not necessarily ensure academic success. It can actually help create an atmosphere of exclusion, wherein students do not feel like they have the same opportunities or privileges as those around them. This can lead to frustration and feelings of inadequacy, as students start to believe that they must achieve a certain grade average to ""deserve"" recognition and reward.

Additionally, a B average requirement serves as a disincentive for many students. Not only does it discourage participation, it can also discourage students from attempting to join in the first place. Instead of giving them the opportunity to grow and learn, it simply sets an arbitrary benchmark that some may struggle to reach. 

Rather than having a B average policy, schools should focus on creating an environment where students are motivated to learn, grow, and develop their hobbies and interests. Activities should be inclusive and easily accessible. Education should be seen as the ultimate goal, and students need to be given the freedom to follow their passions and explore different options. A no-grades policy is the best way to ensure this happens.",AI

Traditional four year high school programs have many valuable benefits compared to three year high school programs. To begin, four year high school programs give students more time to explore a variety of different subjects and develop their academic interests. Students are able to explore content outside of their required courses, like music, theatre, and a variety of other electives, allowing them to expand their knowledge and foster meaningful relationships with their peers and teachers. Furthermore, four year programs can provide students with more realistic expectations about the difficulty and expectations of college courses, which can help them better prepare for the demands of higher education.

By comparison, three year programs often focus on a more limited set of topics and can impose more pressure on students to excel in a narrow range of study. While advancing through the educational pipeline quicker can save time and money, it may also leave students less prepared for college coursework. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities can also be difficult in three year programs, as students have less time to explore their interests. 

In conclusion, traditional four year high school programs offer more opportunities for students to broaden their knowledge base and better understand the college experience ahead of them. Though three year programs may offer economic advantages, their outcomes may be ill-suited to future success.",AI

The three-year high school program is an alternative to the traditional four-year cycle that can help students graduating early, save tuition costs, or enter college earlier. While the program offers some advantages, there are also several potential drawbacks that must be considered. 

On the positive side, students can graduate high school one year sooner than if they had followed the tradition four-year program. This can make college easier to manage by eliminating extra financial expenses and allowing students more time to focus on their studies. Additionally, students who are looking to pursue specialized education pathways or training can benefit from the three-year program by entering college sooner and gaining that extra year of experience before entering the workforce. 

On the other hand, one of the biggest downsides to the three-year program is the potential limited exposure to different classes and other learning opportunities. High school students might not have the time to develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed in the college environment if they don’t have access to a full range of classes. Also, the loss of the extra year of high school could make it harder to transition socially and might add an extra level of stress as students try to adapt to college life. 

The three-year high school program has both advantages and disadvantages for students. While it can help students get to college sooner and reduce the cost of tuition, the limited exposure to different classes and social aspects should be taken into account before making a decision.",AI

In modern society, it has become a common mindset that one should continually grow and strive for more than what they currently have. This mentality is often indicative of strong ambition and personal drive, as wanting to move forward and pursue more is seen as a positive attribute. While some may argue that it is possible to maintain a status quo and have a fulfilling life, it is essential to continue growing and pushing the boundaries of our capabilities in a variety of ways.

Continuing to grow and strive for more beyond what you have achieved can lead to positive outcomes, such as increased confidence in oneself and the ability to tackle increasingly difficult tasks. Utilizing existing successes as motivation and fuel for success can propel one closer to their goals. Additionally, growth can come in the form of experiences or knowledge, as gaining new perspectives and skills could lead to a more successful future.

On the other hand, stagnation and resistance to growth can be limiting. In the absence of ambition or goals, individuals may lack the direction necessary to lead a productive life. Allowing oneself to become too comfortable with their current accomplishments and refusing to pursue more can lead to a lack of purpose or joy in their life. Without continual growth, it can become easy to become complacent with one’s achievements and fail to recognize potential to strive for greater heights.

Overall, continuing to grow and strive beyond what one has achieved is an important component for a successful life. By embracing growth and utilizing existing successes as motivation, one can push boundaries and challenge themselves. Stagnancy, however, can lead to feelings of complacency and lack of meaningful direction. It is thus essential for individuals to continue growing and striving to achieve greater heights.",AI

As humans, we are always looking to grow and evolve into something better. We often find ourselves looking to do something beyond what we have already mastered or to learn a different skill. This desire to take on something new can be a valuable tool to help us grow and develop.

One example of this is in the world of athletics. Athletes are constantly looking to take their existing skills to the next level by adding a new one. They may choose to work on improving their speed or agility or even to try a different sport altogether. This process helps them become well-rounded athletes and ultimately to better themselves.

In the same way, people often look to improve their existing skills in order to find success in a job or career. For example, someone starting out in an entry-level job may take a course, or even just read a book, to learn something new that will help them get ahead. The same can be said of those looking to change careers or become an entrepreneur.

Ultimately, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered not only helps you to grow but is also important to reaching your goals and achieving success.

Having a good attitude is one of the most important factors for leading a happy and successful life. It can make or break a person's experience in the highly competitive environments of school or work. Studies show that having a positive attitude helps to maximize a person's potential and increases performance. For example, many athletes cite their positive attitude as one of the contributing factors to their success. A good attitude can also lead to greater success in relationships, as demonstrated by research that has found correlation between having a positive outlook and experiencing satisfying relationships.

On the other hand, although having a good attitude most of the time can bring many benefits, it can be detrimental in certain situations. For instance, when faced with challenging tasks, having a too positive outlook can lead to an unrealistic estimation of one's ability to accomplish the task. This can cause disappointment and diminish motivation. 

It is of utmost importance for parents to teach children how to cultivate an optimistic attitude and instill in them the understanding of why attitude matters. Studies have shown that developing a positive outlook from a young age increases chances of having successful outcomes in adult years.",AI

Winston Churchill said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal - it is the courage to continue that counts.” This phrase highlights the importance of perseverance in the pursuit of success, emphasizing that even if you face failure, it is important to keep going in order to eventually achieve success. Failure can lead to success in a variety of ways. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed more than 1,000 times while testing different lightbulb designs, but eventually made an important breakthrough that enabled electricity to be used in homes. Conversely, failure can create problems that can quickly snowball out of control. For example, a construction project that is done on a deadline may not leave enough time for mistakes to be corrected, leading to costly and time-consuming delays. When facing failure, the best approach is to face it head-on. Take the time to reflect on the mistake and learn from it, then identify ways to improve the process for future endeavors. Additionally, it is important to seek input from others who can help to identify potential solutions. Ultimately, failure is an inescapable part of the success process - recognizing and learning from failure is crucial to achieving success in the long run.",AI

Community service can bring about substantial positive changes to our school community and beyond. Allowing students to complete mandatory service hours could help form an active, compassionate and responsible student body that goes out into the world prepared to create positive change. 

We should start teaching students to give back to their community right away. When everybody pitches in a little, the benefits are felt by many. For instance, community service encourages youth to become better informed citizens, as they start to think more about the wider implications of their actions for their community, and the world beyond. Through community service, our students would learn to prioritize collaboration and collective problem-solving, as well as acquire habits that promote positive social values. 

Along with developing an understanding of societal issues, volunteerism helps to build self-confidence and practical skills.

Additionally, I analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each potential career. Carefully weighing my options, I settle on the one that best suits my interests, skills, and abilities. After careful evaluation, I have concluded that the career which best suits my interests, skills, and abilities is _______________________.",AI

Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote suggests that although failure can lead to a sense of disappointment, it does not have to be the end of the story. Failure can actually be a stepping stone to eventual success.

One example of someone who successfully used failure to propel them to success is Thomas Edison. He famously failed 10,000 times when trying to invent the light bulb, yet persevered and eventually succeeded. This is an insightful example of how failure can be used as a learning experience and can ultimately lead to success.

Similarly, many entrepreneurs have experienced a number of failures before finally realizing success. They use each failure to evaluate their strategies and how they can improve their approach to build a better business. As difficult as it can be, failure for an entrepreneur can be a stepping stone to success and viewing it as such is essential for success.

Ultimately, failure can indeed lead to success, as demonstrated by Winston Churchill's quote and by a range of successful individuals and entrepreneurs. Rather than being fearful of failure, it is important to embrace it and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. By understanding the power of failure, it is possible to use it to achieve ultimate success.",AI

When considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. This can help ensure that no one person is overwhelmed with too much work and hold the team accountable for completing their tasks in a timely manner.

Furthermore, working with others provides an opportunity for people to learn from each other. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. Working in a group also leads to a sense of community and collaboration, which can help build rapport between members. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that there are many benefits of working in a group versus working alone. From increased productivity and effort, to learning from each other and creating a sense of community, working in a group can help people to make progress on challenging projects, learn new skills, and work together towards a common goal.",AI

It's important to be yourself, even if it means that fewer people might like or understand you. Being someone you are not, even to fit in, can come at a cost. Many people pretend to be someone else out of fear of judgment, but this can harm the person pretending as well as the person they are pretending to be. Posing as someone else can make it more difficult to trust yourself and make decisions, as well as stunt your personal growth. Not only that, but it can have a negative effect on society if we are all pretending to be people we are not. People need to see each other for who they really are - only then will society be able to come together, even if it contains diverse groups of people. When everyone is able to express who they really are, then relationships become more authentic and honest. Being yourself is important, and the impact it could have on society as a whole should not be understated.",AI

Distance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.

At the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Certain students, such as those who do not have consistent access to the internet or reliable technology, may face difficulty in completing their course material in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.

Overall, the pros and cons of distance learning must be weighed carefully depending on each individual student's learning requirements and situation. Distance learning can be an effective and beneficial form of learning in some contexts, but it can also be limiting and counterproductive in others.",AI

The digital age has changed the landscape of interpersonal relationships and provided us with a multitude of tools to communicate in a wide variety of ways. While these tools have enabled us to connect with friends and family from around the world, technology has also had some negative effects on relationships as well. A major issue lies in the amount of time that is devoted to and is lost with social media. Spending too much time on social networks such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook can have a significant impact on relationships. It can create a disconnect between people by replacing face-to-face contact with virtual interaction. Furthermore, individuals may find themselves more comfortable confiding in social media apps rather than discussing their problems with their friends in person. Finally, the reliance on technology can lead to a lack of basic social skills such as active listening and reading body language; skills that form a vital part of forming and maintaining relationships. The overreliance on technology in the digital age is having a negative effect on interpersonal relationships, and it is important to establish a balance for our own well-being and the well-being of those around us.",AI

Organizing a community service project to help improve the environment in my local area requires breaking the project into smaller, manageable steps. First, I must identify a specific goal for the project. Some possible goals could be to reduce air and water pollution, plant more trees, clean up parks and public areas, and so on. Once I have identified the goal for the project, I must specify how this goal can be achieved. For example, if my goal is to plant more trees, I must determine the type of tree and how many trees will be planted and the location for the planting.

Next, I need to determine any additional resources needed for the project such as plants, soil, tools, funds, volunteers, and so on. I must also create an outreach plan for getting the help needed in order to successfully complete the project. This could involve reaching out to local businesses or organizations for donations or support, recruiting volunteers, and leveraging social media.

Though 224 years have passed since Thomas Jefferson wrote in his autobiography that ""it is wonderful how much may be done, if we are always doing,"" his words of wisdom still have relevance in modern life. We still face the temptation to idleness: checking social media continually, wasting time and energy on inconsequential tasks, trying to avoid doing work, and opting out of difficult conversations. In the same way that we can manage our physical health by getting enough sleep, eating right, and exercising, we can maintain our mental health by managing our time and avoiding idleness. 

In my own experiences, I have found that when I avoid idleness and have a plan for how I will use my time, I am able to remain productive and focused throughout the day. Over time, I have also learned that not responding to provocation is a surefire way to avoid idleness. When I am tempted to dodge work, feuds with coworkers, or lambast people on social media, I can regain my composure by not reacting. When I remain positive in the face of difficult situations, I can maintain my mental health and avoid wasting my time. 

Though technology, lifestyle, and culture have obviously changed since 1787, Thomas Jefferson's words still ring true: we can all avoid idleness by managing our time and not responding to provocation. Doing so will not only benefit our mental health, but could also help to achieve amazing things.",AI

In the modern world, where people are increasingly pressed for time and working long hours, the idea of a four-day work week with each day consisting of ten hours at school has become the subject of much debate. On the one hand, having four days at school could have many advantages. Firstly, by packing the same amount of material into four days instead of five, students would have more time to dedicate to other areas. This could be used to get more sleep, take part in extra-curricular activities, or to spend time with family and friends. Secondly, it would allow students to reduce the amount of time they spend commuting, which could have a positive effect on their stress levels. 

On the other hand, having four days instead of five would present some cons as well. It would mean that students would have a greater amount of material to cover in every class compared to a five-day week, by 20 percent in total. This could lead to burnout, as well as reduce the amount of time that students have to fully comprehend the material. Additionally, it could lead to a greater focus on memorizing material over actually understanding it, further reducing students’ knowledge. 

Overall, increasing the length of school days from five to four with each day being ten hours long is an idea that could bring advantages to students, such as having more free time and reducing their stress levels, but also has some downsides such as leading to burnout and reducing students’ knowledge. It is important to carefully weigh both the pros and cons before making any decisions regarding this issue.",AI

When considering whether to ask one person or multiple people for advice, there are several pros and cons to consider. Asking one person means that individual is likely more familiar with the situation and may be better able to provide specific, detailed advice. Quoting John C. Maxwell: “When I need to make a tough decision, I usually ask one wise person I trust.” On the other hand, asking multiple people for advice can provide a variety of perspectives and insights. As the saying goes, “Two heads are better than one.” Personal anecdotes can also be useful; For example, one person might have asked advice from three friends and found that taking a combination of all their advice was more effective than following any one of them exclusively. 

Overall, I believe that asking one person for advice is the most beneficial. It allows for a more personal and detailed understanding of the situation and potential best course of action. Additionally, the expertise of one trusted individual can often be more reliable than the general consensus of multiple people.",AI

Our enthusiasm is one of the most important catalysts in achieving success. After all, if you lack passion in pursuing your goals, it will become increasingly difficult to stay motivated along the journey. In addition to enthusiasm, the willingness to accept failure plays an equally important role in succeeding. Overcoming failure strengthens our resilience and provides opportunities to learn from our mistakes and improve. This can be seen in the history of many of our most successful innovators. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed 1,000 times in his attempt to invent the lightbulb, but he persevered and eventually succeeded. This anecdote illustrates how failure can sometimes be a necessary step to reach success. 

Therefore, we must embrace failure wholeheartedly and not be scared of the roadblocks that are put in our way. We must actively seek out opportunities, try new things, and create a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Learning to accept failure can help us grow and provide us with valuable lessons to learn from. With enthusiasm in our hearts and an open mind to failure, we will have the resources to succeed.",AI

Self-reliance and making independent decisions are essential keys to personal growth. Individuals should strive to become self-sufficient and learn to make decisions on their own. For example, when making a major life decision such as buying a house, getting married, or dropping out of school, individuals should rely on themselves rather than asking for help or advice from someone else, as it allows for greater personal growth and self-efficacy. Asking for someone else's opinion when making a decision can sometimes be detrimental, since it allows for external influence, thus limiting an individual's independence and autonomy. Therefore, it is important to practice self-reliance and develop the capacity to make independent decisions in order to achieve personal growth.",AI

The late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared that “success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This statement holds a great deal of truth in its meaning, as while failure is unavoidable, those who maintain enthusiasm when things don’t go their way are able to remain positive and even learn from their mistakes. Learning from failure is essential for success, as an individual who fails and then strives to improve from their experience is likely to reach their desired outcome. Perseverance can be a great asset in this respect, as an individual who does not surrender to failure is more likely to find success in the end. 

On the other hand, it is not necessary to fail in order to learn and find success.

Year-round education and the traditional school approach both have their advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, year-round education can result in a greater retention of material for students, since the breaks between classes are shorter and students are able to stay engaged and motivated to learn for longer periods of time. At the same time, students must also put in more effort to complete the same amount of material within the shorter schedule, and teachers must adjust their plans more often.

The school board must also take into account the effects of a year-round schedule in terms of preparation for tests. It may be difficult for students to remember what they learned after an extended break, and the shortened break periods of a year-round approach may require more frequent testing that could add to the stress levels of students.

In summary, while year-round education can lead to increased student retention and engagement, the increased effort and frequency of testing can lead to more stress and difficulty for students and the school board. Careful consideration is needed to determine which approach best suits a given school's circumstances.",AI

The question of implementing a four-day school week with extended hours for primary and secondary schools in the United States is complex. Proponents of the scheme point out that it could save schools money on staff and transportation, as well as reducing absences and tardiness. Additionally, the extended days could give students more time for collaborative projects, experiential learning, and individualized instruction. 

On the other hand, opponents worry that the extended days could be difficult for working parents to manage, and that student learning could suffer if teachers are unable to cover the same amount of content in fewer days. Additionally, lower-income students could be disproportionately impacted, as they are less likely to have access to childcare and other academic resources outside of school.

Balancing these concerns, it appears that a four-day school week with extended hours is likely to be beneficial in some cases, such as rural communities or schools with tight budgets. However, extensive research should be done to ensure the implementation of such a scheme does not negatively impact student learning or access to education for all students.",AI

Albert Einstein was a firm believer in the importance of imagination and knowledge in equal measure. He said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."" By combining imagination and knowledge, both individuals and society can develop solutions and build positive change. For example, it is imagination that successfully takes a concept from inception to reality. However, knowledge is essential for refining ideas to turn them into tangible solutions. 

Albert Einstein also saw the power of a child’s imagination first-hand, noting how it could inspire innovation and creativity. He said, “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.” However, if this imagination is not nurtured in a positive way, it could have the opposite effect and ultimately stunt the development of a child’s creativity. Fear can often be used to control children, either directly or indirectly, and this can lead to the repressing of their imagination.

With the college admissions process becoming increasingly competitive, there are several steps one should take to ensure they have the best chance of being accepted. To get into college, a student should focus on their academics first and foremost, setting a study schedule that allows them to dedicate time to their classes, sports practice, and any other activities. Additionally, they should take advantage of any tutoring services that are available for Math and English, places where they can hone their skills and ask for advice.

When considering the pros and cons of a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer, there are several different points to consider. On the one hand, adding an hour and a half to the school day would give students more time to cover material in their classes, which could benefit their grades and increase their opportunities for success. Additionally, it could provide more time for students to complete after-school activities such as sports and arts programs, as well as give students extra time to complete their homework or participate in extra study sessions. 

On the other hand, a longer school day could mean an overall decrease in the amount of free time students have to themselves. This could lead to unnecessary stress, as students feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete in a day. Additionally, it could also lead to exhaustion, as students can become worn down by having less time to rest and recharge.

The renowned jazz musician Duke Ellington once asserted: “A problem is a chance for you to do your best.” This inspiring statement encourages us to look at challenges as opportunities rather than burdens. From a sociopsychological perspective, this notion is particularly persuasive because it encourages a productive growth mindset rather than a fixed, prisoner-to-the-problem mentality. 

I thoroughly agree with Ellington’s statement. There is no doubt that problems are difficult and daunting, but Ellington’s quote encourages us to remember that a successful resolution to a problem requires hard work, perseverance, and dedication, and therefore presents an opportunity to hone our skills and potentially reap satisfying rewards. Moreover, being able to rise to the occasion and find innovative solutions to challenging issues can result in a sense of pride and accomplishment that stays with us long after the task is completed.

Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early.

In 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement, a rallying cry for determination in the face of difficulty, has been held as an essential tenet of success. The idea of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm has strong advantages - being resilient and passionate in the face of struggle can help an individual persist and ultimately achieve success. 

Conversely, going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm can be extremely detrimental. When faced with failure, a discouraged attitude can lead an individual to become apathetic, and even worse, to give up altogether. It is important to recognize the distinction between both approaches to success, and opt for the former whenever possible.

Throughout history, many figures have illustrated the power of Churchill's words. For example, inventor Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before discovering the first working incandescent lightbulb. His refusal to let failure stand in his way highlights the importance of sustaining enthusiasm and resilience in the pursuit of success. African American Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks showed similar determination when she took a stand against segregation on a Montgomery bus in 1955.

Summer break is an essential part of the academic calendar for many students and can offer a number of important benefits over having breaks throughout the year. Firstly, by having one break over a long period, students may be more likely to retain what they’ve learned prior to their break, without detrimental effects from repeated long breaks throughout the year. Additionally, having an extended period away from school gives students a much needed mental health break and time to reconnect with family and friends. 

Furthermore, having all breaks in a concentrated period allows students to focus on other activities such as part-time jobs, or internships to develop life skills and can help alleviate any pressures that may arise if they are trying to manage part-time work throughout the year alongside school. Finally, summer break can be used to revise and strengthen understanding of difficult topics that had been encountered during the year, allowing students to return to school feeling more prepared and more successful in their studies.

Completing a full four years of high school before moving on to college can help students build essential skills and gain knowledge for their future. For instance, skills such as better time management, organization, writing, and study techniques can be developed over the four year period. This can help students apply these skills to their college courses, eventually translating into better grades and success. 

On the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. 

For example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. As a result, her grades began to suffer.

It is clear that while leaving high school early can be appealing to some, it is important to consider the effects it may have on a student's future. Taking the four year high school experience can help them prepare for the rigors of college by developing crucial skills and knowledge, while also allowing them to build maturity and grow into adulthood.",AI

The effects of technology limiting human contact have been widely researched and debated. On one hand, technology has enabled people to connect from literally any corner of the world in an instant. Through social media and video-conferencing, family members who live far away can easily stay in touch, filling thousands of miles of physical space with the warmth of digital connection. In addition, with the rise of freelance work, more and more people have been able to turn their passions into professions without ever having to leave their homes; they can take on jobs located anywhere and communicate seamlessly to reach their goals. 

On the other hand, such restriction of human contact, while convenient, can also have its drawbacks. The loss of some in-person connections and social interactions has the potential to increase feelings of isolation and depression. In addition, digital contact does not always amount to satisfactory communication; meaningful conversations and emotional bonds can only truly be formed through face-to-face contact. Finally, the infiltration of technology into nearly every realm of our lives can lead to overstimulation and couldn’t-care-less attitudes, as people become too overwhelmed or desensitized to take action.

One of the main advantages of reducing the work week or school week to four days is the potential cost savings that can be achieved. By making the switch, companies can reduce the amount of energy they use, which can lead to lower bills. Additionally, businesses can save money by reducing the amount of personnel that they need, and schools can save money on things like facility costs and transportation. 

However, there are also numerous disadvantages to instituting such a schedule. For instance, many employees may struggle to stay focused during a 10-hour workday and may find their productivity declining due to exhaustion. Additionally, students in a longer school day may have difficulty staying motivated for the extra two hours each day. 

Ultimately, it is important to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work or school week. Decisions should be made based not only on cost savings, but also on the potential impact that such a schedule could have on productivity, morale, and overall quality of life.",AI

Thomas Jefferson once declared that “Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.” His words illustrate the concept that taking consistent action can be rewarding in prodigious ways. Consistent action does not merely mean physical action. It covers devising plans, laying foundations, and dedicating time and energy to a specific goal. 

If one chooses to be idle, then they are likely to idle away the days in procrastination and avoidance. But those who understand the importance of hard work and determination will not sit by and allow life to simply pass them by. Instead, they will make use of time, using it to hone their skills and work towards the life they hope to build. With consistent effort, one can create a lasting legacy and memorable impact on the world.

Persistence, hard work, and determination are the hallmarks of successful people. Indeed, these are the components required to achieve any goal, no matter the size or scope. Making the decision to “never be idle” takes courage, resolve, and dedication, yet they are essential to progress. To put it simply, results can only come from consistent action over an extended period of time. 

By adhering to Thomas Jefferson’s quote and being proactive rather than reactive, a person stands the best chance of succeeding. A well-defined plan plus consistent implementation is the means by which dreams are actualized. The process may be lengthy and laborious, but the rewards are well worth the effort.",AI

Forcing all students to participate in extracurricular activities can be detrimental to their own self-development. Students should be able to decide for themselves how to spend their free time, as this allows them to find their own passions and interests, which can help them to have a successful and fulfilling life. 

For example, Betty is an academically driven student who is extremely passionate about mathematics, and wants to pursue a career in computer science. But due to the principal's rule, she is forced to participate in the school's basketball team. As a result, she lacks the time and energy to focus on what she actually loves, which hinders her studies and puts her future career in jeopardy. 

On the other hand, Adam is a student who loves outdoor activities and pursues a career in rock climbing. Since he doesn't have the same interests as the rest of the students and the principal doesn't provide options for different extracurricular activities, Adam is not able to pursue his dream in the school hours and is limited in his educational and career progress. 

In summary, forcing all students to participate in the same extracurricular activities suppresses their individual self-development and doesn't allow them to pursue the things they are truly passionate about. ",AI

Many societies around the world unfortunately suffer from the pervasive problem of people not being treated with kindness or respect. This cultural trend can have a powerful negative impact on individuals' mental and emotional wellbeing, as their sense of self-worth or belonging to a community may be profoundly damaged. Additionally, when exposed to continual disrespect and unkindness, it can lead an individual to become stressed or anxious in daily life and reduce their ability to form meaningful connections with others.

Additionally, it can build and strengthen individuals' ability to empathize with one another, promoting a more trusting and cohesive society.",AI

Failure plays a crucial role in the pursuit of success. Instead of viewing failure as a roadblock, we should see it as a valuable learning opportunity. By taking risks and failing, we can develop a better understanding of what works and what does not. Through analyzing our successes and failures, we can gain insights into the underlying skills necessary for achieving success. We must understand that failure is a necessary part of growth and success. Without failure, we cannot appreciate the small victories and measures of progress that occur on the path to success. 

On the other hand, failure can be devastating and cause people to give up. It can be discouraging and make the goal of success seem like an impossible task. But, it is important to remember that failure should not be all-encompassing and it should not define who you are. It is only a moment in time and a negative experience can eventually lead to positive results. 

Ultimately, embracing our failures and learning from them is essential in the pursuit of success. Even if failure leads you down a different path, it can still result in achieving your goals. Although failure can be daunting and a source of frustration, it can also lead to meaningful connections, newfound confidence, and valuable lessons. Learning from our past experiences and taking a constructive approach to failure will make us better prepared and more successful on our journeys.",AI

Character traits are essential tools in determining who we are and how we interact with the world around us. Whether we are consciously choosing our characteristics or they have been molded by our environment, our traits have the potential to profoundly shape our lives.

When individuals take on the task of examining their traits and actively choosing which ones to foster or abandon, they are engaging in the practice of self-development. Being aware and mindful of the qualities that define us and the consequences they may have, allows us to take control of our lives and create our own destiny. These actions can lead to greater autonomy, happiness, and satisfaction with our decisions, as we are empowering ourselves instead of allowing ourselves to be a product of external forces.

On the other hand, when character traits are acquired due to outside circumstances, we are left in a vulnerable state, as we are not in control of the messages conveyed by our traits. Depending on our upbringing, peer group, or societal norms, the traits that form us can be limiting and inhibit us from reaching our desired goals. If we do not question and challenge what has been instilled in us, we may become victim to our own preconceived beliefs and succumb to our environment’s restrictions.

Therefore, it is important for us to become mindful of our character traits, as they play an integral role in determining the direction of our lives. Self-development and intentional self-growth can grant us the freedom to pursue our passions and find fulfillment in our lives.",AI

Inactivity can have a major impact on a person's life and those of their family in many ways. Physically, it can affect a person's health due to a lack of regular exercise and an inability to properly manage weight. Emotionally, it can lead to feelings of apathy and depression, due to reduced physical, social, and mental activity. And financially, inactivity can lead to decreased work productivity and economic growth. 

Despite the effects of inactivity, some people are able to overcome it. Through dedication and a drive to succeed, people have found their purpose and become self-motivated to overcome inactivity. Examples of people who have achieved personal and professional success despite inactivity include professional athletes who overcame injuries or health problems, entrepreneurs who managed to innovate despite the odds, and everyday individuals who became successful through self-help and a proactive mindset. 

Inactivity has a huge effect on employment and economic growth. Without people who are able to be productive, businesses suffer and overall growth declines. A person's ability to remain active is paramount for a nation to experience economic growth. Therefore, having a sense of purpose and a commitment to remain active is crucial to achieving success. 

To sum it up, inactivity can have a major effect on people's lives, both physically, emotionally, and financially. Despite this, people are capable of achieving personal and professional success through determination, dedication, and a proactive mindset.

High school is an important time for teenagers as they are forming the values, skills, and decisions that lay the foundation for their future. The courses they take, the skills that they develop, the support they receive, and the legacy they leave are all powerful influences on their careers. 

The courses students take in high school provide them with skills that are essential to any future career they chose. Students are exposed to a range of academic and practical topics, which develop their knowledge and abilities. For example, the language courses help students to build their communication skills and the science classes can provide the knowledge they need for a career in medicine or engineering. The courses and activities students undertake in high school provide a rich educational experience that can help them to determine what kind of career they want to pursue.

Parental support can play a critical role in a student’s future career. Parents can offer guidance and advice to help their children make the right decisions. They can help students to understand their strengths and weaknesses and to explore different options that are available. This support can make it easier for students to make the right choices for their future. 

The school staff, such as teachers and counselors, can also play an important role in helping students to consider their future career. These professionals can provide valuable guidance and insight about the options available to students and can be a great source of support.

First impressions have a great power to shape our interactions and relationships with others, in both social contexts and business settings. When meeting someone new, we establish initial thoughts and opinions of that person based on behavior, appearance, and initial interactions.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” As I’ve grown older, I’ve come to appreciate and understand the essence of his wise words. Being yourself allows you to have a sense of confidence and comfort in yourself, and makes it easier to express and share your ideas with others. It helps us develop and become better people by allowing us to gain knowledge and experiences in life. 

We often face pressure to conform or fit into certain social roles or expectations, and, while it may be easier to simply comply with the status quo, there is nothing quite like finding the courage and inner peace that comes from being yourself, regardless of what society thinks. Accepting ourselves and who we are is one of the most important steps we can take in life. 

Overall, Emerson’s words are as relevant today as ever. We all need to be reminded from time to time why it is so important to be ourselves and to realize the greatness that exists within all of us.

Extending the school day can be both a blessing and a curse for students. On the one hand, four days of school can be fewer school days in a week and may allow students to feel less overwhelmed with work and have more free time to do what they love. Some educators and parents have posited that students could experience a “work smarter, not harder” approach with four days to spread their work out over the extended school day, promote student-driven learning, and potentially have classes that are more engaging. 

On the other hand, the extended school days might put an overwhelming amount of pressure on students. Having four days of school instead of five may result in more hours of scarce study time, more challenging teacher expectations, and more cumulative material to cover. This could lead to excessive stress on students, longer days of being in a focused state, and ultimately exhaustion. Additionally, there may be a potential financial burden that may come with the extended school days, such as the need to hire more staff and administration and the potential for less hands-on learning if resources are cut. 

Despite the potential drawbacks, there are potential benefits from having four days of school. With the extended school day, students may be able to engage in more in-depth learning, be able to learn at a faster pace, and have more individualized attention in classes as the school day is more spread out. It could also result in less time overall that children spend on screens or electronic devices throughout the week, as they will have more days free to explore and engage in activities with friends and family. 

In conclusion, the pros and cons of extending the school day and having four days a week are complex and varied. It is essential that a thorough analysis of these potential changes to the educational system be done to foster an environment that is conducive to long-term student success.",AI

Having positive people around us is essential to maintain healthy self-esteem. By this, I mean people who validate our emotions and give us encouraging words. These people support us, no matter the situation, believing in the potential we have, and understanding us, which in turn helps us build more self-confidence. They help us see that our efforts are being noticed, thus boosting our self-esteem.

On the other hand, it is important to know how to handle negative people who want to change us. It can be quite difficult to resist the temptation to please them, because we want to feel accepted, even when this might mean doing something against our values. However, we need to be aware that these people may have the wrong intentions, and that if we oblige to their demands, we might lose our self-esteem in the long run.

I have experienced both scenarios. I had a teacher who believed in my abilities, and she kept pushing me to do more, until I achieved what I had set out to do. This built my self-esteem, showing me that I was capable of much more than I thought.Similarly, I had a friend who constantly put me down, never recognizing the things I did right.

One of the best ways to show intelligence is by having a deep understanding of a particular subject matter, through diligently studying and researching facts about that area of expertise. An additional way to show intelligence is working out puzzles and strategies for problem-solving, such as creating a spreadsheet or other type of presentation to explain complex concepts.

To show off talents, it can include skills in music, art, writing, and other creative talents. For example, if someone is good at playing the guitar and participating in choirs, that is one way to demonstrate their talent. Additionally, someone who is a skilled writer can demonstrate their talent through experiences such as writing short story or articles for publications.

To show off one’s athletic ability, it can be anything that involves physical strength, flexibility and endurance. As an example, for someone who wants to show off their athletic ability, they could demonstrate things such as running, weightlifting or playing a sport. Being able to show how they achieve higher endurance by continually increasing times for running a certain distance or being able to lift heavier weights are both ways to show athletic abilities.

The key to each of these skills is to demonstrate the qualities that make them unique. This could include being able to memorize an entire text book on a certain subject, or being able to make a beautiful painting in a short amount of time. Being able to explain why these skills have been developed, such as growing up in a particular environment or actively seeking out related opportunities gives it more credibility. 

Overall, many unique skills across different areas such as intelligence, talent and athletic abilities, all lend to a person’s individual identity.

Additionally, those who participate in school sports could benefit from a menu that is specifically tailored to ensure they are receiving the necessary vitamins and minerals that will help with hydration, energy, and muscle repair. Finally, students who may not be receiving enough nutrients or variety at home could receive the necessary vitamins and minerals that their bodies need for growth.

The advantages of changing the school lunch menu are extensive. This change could improve the health of students and contribute to overall well-being. It could also provide students who are unwell with healthier and nutritious meals, give students participating in school sports the nutritional requirements for their sport, and provide those who may be going hungry with a balanced and nutritious diet. Ultimately, this change could ensure that students get the sustenance they need to thrive.",AI

School is an invaluable opportunity to learn valuable lessons that can stay with us throughout our lives. One of the most important lessons students can learn at school is how to think critically and objectively. Understanding critical thinking can help students develop better problem-solving skills, make more informed decisions, and ultimately contribute to more successful outcomes in their future endeavors.

Critical thinking in the classroom teaches students to think beyond what is being presented to them and to challenge assumptions and ideas. With the help of teachers, students learn how to evaluate various sources of information, identify multiple perspectives on an issue, and weigh the evidence to arrive at a reasonable conclusion. This can make them better informed citizens, better prepared in their jobs, and better able to participate in critical conversations.

Learning how to think critically is also important because it helps us develop our own independent thought processes and strengthen our ability to make our own judgments. It encourages a sense of curiosity and exploration and allows us to better analyze existing data objectively to draw our own conclusions about the world around us. This can help us become more confident and independent learners, which can help us in our future studies and careers.

Ultimately, developing critical thinking skills is an essential life skill that can benefit students in their future. It can help them to better make decisions, more effectively participate in critical conversations, and confidently navigate various challenges they may face in their lives.",AI

Knowledge is an undeniable key to success. Many of the greatest minds throughout history have proven this to be true, especially in the modern world. With knowledge, people are able to confirm theories and construct pathways to progress. On the other hand, imagination has its limitations. While it has the potential to spark innovation, imagination alone cannot lead to certainty or progress without the application of knowledge. 

Take, for instance, the impact of the printing press on the expansion of knowledge in Europe. Before its invention in 1440, Europeans had to rely on handwritten texts, limiting the spread of knowledge. However, Gutenberg’s invention of printing technology revolutionized the way knowledge is distributed, enabling Europeans to access and record knowledge more quickly and accurately. This is just one example of how knowledge has been used to bring progress to our world.

In contrast, imagination does have its benefits. It has the capacity to provide fresh ideas and break the status quo. It can act as a catalyst for creativity and exploration. Yet, without a basis of knowledge, these ideas can remain just as stagnant as a wild thought. 

Ultimately, knowledge is essential for turning imaginative dreams into reality. It is the monument which plans and ideas are built on. No great achievement was ever accomplished without the application of knowledge. Therefore, it is clear that knowledge is more valuable than imagination alone.",AI

Excerpt: 
Winston Churchill famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This quote encapsulates how failure, hope, and enthusiasm are all integral components in achieving success. When we face failure, hope and enthusiasm are the sparks that help us keep going and persevere in our journey. Without hope, it can be easy to give up when faced with failure. And without enthusiasm, hope can quickly turn into discouragement. By combining the two, we are able to face failure head-on and continue striving forward despite the setbacks. With an enthusiasm for the journey, failure is no longer a dead end but rather a learning opportunity. Hope keeps us believing that if we keep trying, we can eventually reach success. Together, hope, failure, and enthusiasm are the essential ingredients for success in life.",AI

Starting a career at a young age can have both benefits and drawbacks. For instance, individuals who become doctors, lawyers, or teachers at a young age may have more energy and enthusiasm for the job and may be able to become masters of the field earlier in life. On the other hand, they may lack experience and mentorship necessary to succeed and could be overwhelmed by the demands of those professions. 

For example, doctors face long hours and intensive educational requirements, and a young doctor may not be able to handle the responsibilities. In contrast, an experienced doctor may have the practical know-how to handle complex cases with greater ease. Likewise, young lawyers and teachers may struggle to manage the paperwork and classroom environment due to their inexperience.

Overall, starting a career at a young age has its advantages and disadvantages. It is important to weigh the pros and cons in light of particular careers before embarking on a new journey.",AI

Excerpt: Online classes have become increasingly popular, offering students the option to study from home instead of attending school in person. There are advantages to both online and regular classes, and it depends on the individual student to determine which will be best for them. 

For students attending classes in-person, one great advantage is the social aspect. They are able to form relationships with their peers and build social skills. Furthermore, techniques such as hands-on learning and real-world application are utilized and can help students find practical solutions to their problems. However, this type of learning may also be stressful for some students, as they have to adjust to the pressures of attending classes in a traditional environment.

Studying online has its advantages as well. First of all, the student has more flexibility when it comes to their studies since they can set their own schedule for when they do their work. Additionally, students are not limited to their physical location as they can attend classes online from anywhere, making it easier for students who have limited access to physical classes. On the other hand, the lack of social interaction and the dependence on self-motivation can be drawbacks for students who are used to attending classes in-person. Furthermore, online courses may not have the same level of resources as a more traditional learning environment. 

In conclusion, when deciding between online and in-person classes, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Each individual student needs to consider their own personal preferences and skills to decide which option best suits their needs.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson's words, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,"" have inspired generations of thinkers to push beyond their comfort zones in search of personal and professional growth. This idea can be applied across a variety of professions, such as entrepreneurs who must have the courage to move into uncharted waters in order to create something new, academics who must stretch the boundaries of existing knowledge, and artists who take risks in their work in order to break new ground. While professional sports players may also strive to expand their skills and knowledge for the sake of progress, they are somewhat of an exception to the rule. This is because a successful sports career is often based upon rigorous practice and training within a pre-established environment. However, even athletes must periodically challenge themselves to innovate in order to stay competitive. Looking beyond the realms of athletics, examples of individuals being pushed out of their comfort zones for growth can be seen in numerous scenarios. From corporate CEOs looking for novel solutions to global problems, to everyday people looking to break free from limiting circumstances, the necessity of venturing outside of one's safely constructed realm of knowledge is a recurring theme.",AI

One way to meet new people without speaking is through body language and nonverbal cues. When you enter a room, look around and make eye contact with the people in the room. Smile and nod your head or wave at people you’d like to get to know better. It’s also easy to tell when someone wants to stay to themselves or wants to talk. If someone is open to conversation, approach them slowly and calmly, introducing yourself with a few details about your life and/or interests.

Having a pet is another great way to meet new people without having to say much. Animal lovers are naturally drawn to animals, so if you have a pet, it’s likely you will have conversations with those who are also drawn to your pet. If you don’t have a pet, you can still try to make friends with people who have one – consider taking your pet for a walk around your neighborhood and striking up a conversation with the other pet owners.

Of course, as with any situation, there are potential positive and negative scenarios associated with meeting new people. On the positive side, you could make new friends, find a new job, or even form a meaningful relationship. On the negative side, you could experience bullying or rejection. As long as you stay open to the possibilities, however, and use your best judgment, the potential positives far outweigh the target negatives.",AI

Making mistakes is an often unfortunate, but essential, part of life. Mistakes can be used as a learning tool, helping to shape our growth and development as we strive for success. Through experimentation and risk-taking, we can gain a better understanding of what we need to do to get ahead. Despite this, it is a view that some people may disagree with, believing that it is better to take a more cautious approach in order to avoid making errors.

However, it is important to understand that mistakes can be a part of the successes that people achieve. Despite our best intentions, mistakes are inevitable and can actually offer benefits. For example, by understanding the consequences of our errors, we gain new skills and knowledge for future tasks and can use this to improve our performance over time. Similarly, when mistakes are made in our personal or professional lives, we can use them as a learning experience and implement better ways of working. 

Ultimately, committing mistakes in life can be beneficial if done in the right way. We should acknowledge that mistakes are simply part of the process and use them to fuel our motivation to succeed. Contrary to the popular belief that mistakes are an embarrassing and negative part of life, mistakes should be seen as an opportunity to grow and develop. Through taking a holistic view of our mistakes and learning how to use them to our advantage, mistakes may in fact be the key to unlocking our potential for success.",AI

Supporters of allowing high school students to complete their studies in three years instead of four may argue that it saves students money, time, and gives them an extra year to pursue higher education, start a career, or travel. From a financial standpoint, three years of high school fees instead of four could be a substantial saving for many families, yielding benefits both during and after education. Time-wise, graduating a year early could give students more breathing space to explore their interests or reach life goals more quickly.

However, some may worry that a three-year program may be too fast-paced; student learning and development may not be given enough attention. Additionally, if the program is not well-planned, students may find themselves missing key topics or skills. Furthermore, if students are required to take certain classes and tests to graduate, these may be a challenge to complete in a shorter timeframe.",AI

First impressions are incredibly important, and our initial encounters with people, ideas, and experiences will often set the tone for our future relationships. Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. Whether we realize it or not, our initial impressions have a powerful impact on our relationships with other people. 

For instance, let’s suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. 

Additionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. To illustrate this point, let’s say that you walk into a party and you are immediately met with a feeling of warmth and acceptance. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. 

From these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.",AI

My grandpa, John, was born in a small fishing village in Ireland. His family was poor so there were many difficulties they faced throughout his childhood including limited access to adequate nutrition and health care. Despite these difficulties, his family managed to make ends meet and give him the best life they possibly could. 

When he was a young man he immigrated to the US alone, seeking a better life for himself and his family. The journey across the ocean was full of challenges and he was required to leave his family behind for the time being. Once he arrived in the US, he faced language barriers, cultural differences, and financial instability which made it difficult for him to settle in.

After several years of hard work, John was finally able to save enough money to bring his family to the US and they were reunited after being apart for many years.

As the old adage goes, “attitude is everything”—and it's true! Having a good attitude can have a tremendous impact on almost every area of our lives, from our personal lives to our professional lives. It can have a powerful effect on our ability to learn things, our chances of getting good results, and even our overall success.

For instance, having a positive attitude can make us better learners because it helps us stay motivated and inspired to keep going even when things get difficult. We are able to persevere when faced with challenges by keeping an optimistic outlook. We are more likely to experiment, ask questions, and learn from our mistakes when our attitude is positive.

Furthermore, a good attitude can directly result in better results in almost any task. When we approach a project with enthusiasm and a can-do attitude, we are more likely to take risks and be creative with our solutions. This open-mindedness and positive outlook tends to lead to more successful outcomes.

I experienced this firsthand when I decided to take on a big writing project while I was still in college. Even though I had no prior experience with the type of writing needed for the project, I was determined to succeed. With a positive attitude, I approached the challenge head on and worked diligently until the project was complete. In the end, the project was a success, and I was even able to win a prize for my work. That is an experience that I will never forget, and I am sure I would not have been so successful had I not had a good attitude.

In conclusion, having a good attitude is beneficial on many levels. It gives us the drive and determination to pursue our goals despite any obstacles we may face. It can also help us achieve better results by keeping us open to learning new things and encouraging us to take risks. No matter how hard the task, having the right attitude can help us to reach our full potential and lead us to success.",AI

With the emergence of technology, distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students. While distance learning has several advantages, such as allowing students to learn at their own pace, providing flexibility in how and when they learn, and potentially reducing the cost of learning materials, there are also potential pitfalls that must be considered. Among these are the potential for increased bullying due to lack of direct supervision, as well as the potential distractedness and lack of social interaction associated with learning in an unstructured environment.

Although distance learning provides many benefits, such as allowing students to have more control over their education, these same benefits can lead to greater responsibility for adolescents and, as a result, increased potential for irresponsibility. This could include dropping out of classes, excessive procrastination, or not following instructor directions, all of which will ultimately lead to a decline in educational performance. 

One group of students that can especially benefit from distance learning are those with extra responsibilities after school or those looking to save money. Not having to worry about expensive transportation to and from campus, as well as the freedom to take classes at different times of the day, can be incredibly liberating and allow students to focus on their studies. Additionally, distance learning can be an excellent way to fit education into a tight schedule while still advancing one’s academic goals.

In conclusion, distance learning is an attractive learning option that can provide students with much needed flexibility, particularly those with extra responsibilities, but it is not without its own set of challenges. Evaluating the potential pros and cons of distance learning can help students make an educated decision about the learning option that is best for them.",AI

Chances for a better future are often snatched away from the vulnerable children in Bangladesh, particularly those suffering from abuse and those with an abnormality. This is due to many socioeconomic factors and the lack of appropriate support, leading to a myriad of developmental problems both now and later in life. To protect and help these children, it is essential that the Bangladeshi government act quickly to provide resources to families in need, especially those who are struggling to raise an abnormal child. 

Action needs to be taken to provide victims of child abuse with appropriate medical and legal assistance. It is also imperative to promote awareness about the consequences of child abuse, so that people in positions of authority or authority figures, such as teachers and healthcare professionals, can identify when a child is in danger and take the necessary steps to protect them. It is also important to provide more access to family and social services, such as counseling, legal advice, and educational interventions so that victims of abuse can receive the help they need. 

For children with disabilities, providing more resources and support is critical to give them the best chance of a successful life. Such resources may include specialized educators, supportive therapies, and the opportunity to attend special classes. There should also be measures in place that allow families to access government funding for medical assistance, access to housing and healthcare, and first step transition programs for disabled children. 

Taking action is essential to create a better future for the abused and abnormal children in Bangladesh.

    Having a positive attitude is essential to creating a successful life full of challenges and opportunities. When faced with a difficult situation, a positive outlook encourages us to stay motivated and resilient. Rather than seeing the problem as an insurmountable obstacle, people with a positive attitude can convert this adversity into an opportunity for personal growth and success. For example, if you are faced with a challenge at work, you can utilize the experience as an opportunity to learn more about the field and develop your skills. If you focus on the negative aspects of the situation, you are more likely to become overwhelmed and give up.

Positive thinking also helps to create a healthier mindset. Rather than ruminating on all the things that can go wrong, it encourages us to focus on the positive aspects of our lives. This can reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Furthermore, having a positive attitude creates an energy that attracts positive people and opportunities. When we focus on the positive things in our lives, we invite positivity into our lives.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is vital to overcoming challenges and creating a successful life.

Having a good imagination is vital for success in both life and work. Imagination is the key to creating new ideas and making them a reality. Additionally, imagination helps us to identify, understand, and solve complex problems. Therefore, having a strong imagination can help us when we are trying to achieve our goals.

Achieving our goals often requires a great deal of effort and dedication. Without learning new information or leveraging our knowledge and skills, it can be difficult to make progress. Having a good understanding of what is required to reach our goals can be beneficial. In particular, having knowledge related to the job we are applying for is important. For example, if an individual is looking for a job in the tech industry, they should have a good knowledge of the industry, the role, and possible companies they could work for.

Quitting just one step away from success can be a difficult concept to understand. After all our hard work, it can seem odd that the outcome is not favorable. But, the importance of having both an imagination and knowledge of the goal is key in these situations. An individual may have a brilliant plan in mind and think it will be successful, only to find out they are missing something. In this case, their lack of knowledge was their downfall and they failed to achieve success even though they were so close to success. 

One example of how imagination and knowledge led to success is the story of Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos. Jeff used his knowledge of the internet and his imagination to envision what the online shopping experience could be like. He used this knowledge and his vision to create Amazon, which is now one of the largest companies in the world. His imaginative and entrepreneurial spirit has allowed him to build an empire and achieve incredible success.

In conclusion, achieving success requires effort, imagination and knowledge. Without all three, it is unlikely that our goals will be achieved. It is important to be aware of the different elements required to reach success and understand how they can work together to create success.",AI

According to research, expecting students to identify a career by the time they enter high school can have many advantages, particularly in terms of giving students an early start to focusing on preparation for their desired career. Such preparation might involve taking relevant classes or courses, engaging in internships, participating in job shadowing experiences, or joining extracurricular activities in their desired career field. This early start could give students an edge when it comes to getting accepted into college and/or the job of their choice after graduation. 

However, there are some drawbacks to students deciding on a career choice late in their educational timeline. For example, the more narrow timeframe could cause them to feel overwhelmed and less likely to take the steps mentioned above to adequately prepare. This could have serious negative implications for the student's future, as a lack of preparation may lead to less desirable college and job choices.

There are also various reasons why some students put off deciding on a career. These can range from lack of knowledge about possibilities, fear of making the wrong decision, or simply feeling unready to commit to one career option. It is important for students to realize that they have plenty of time to hone in on their career choice and that they do not need to make a final decision before they start their high school journey.",AI

First impressions are almost impossible to change. They set the tone for the duration of a relationship or interaction, and because of this importance, people are likely to remember a poor first impression for a long time. It is difficult to rewire the initial feeling of dislike, distrust, or distaste towards a person once it has been established. For instance, if someone has made a wildly inappropriate joke or done something else disrespectful in their introduction, it is almost improbable to get someone to change their opinion of that person and see them in a different light. 

Personal experiences are the most illustrative examples demonstrating the permanence of first impressions. I remember meeting a friend's new partner for the first time and being thoroughly unimpressed by his behavior. He was rude and had a flippant attitude, and I instantly disliked him. Even though I have seen him multiple times since then and can see him making an effort to show a different character, he has never been able to shake off that feeling of dislike that I got from the first impression.

It is unfortunately this way with almost all relationships and ways of interacting with people, which further emphasizes why first impressions are so important and why it is vital that we try and ensure people get the best version of ourselves from the beginning. It is nearly impossible to change the feeling associated with a first impression, so care must be taken to ensure it is a good one.",AI

Playing sports can be a great opportunity for students to stay active, socialize with peers, and learn important skills. However, playing a sport as a student also has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, playing a sport can improve physical fitness and help students develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, discipline, and goal setting. Additionally, participating in a team sport can provide students with a unique outlet for stress relief, an opportunity to make friends, and even a sense of accomplishment from winning games or tournaments. 

On the other hand, playing a sport can be time-consuming and expensive. In addition to the cost of equipment, uniforms, and fees associated with joining a team, students may need to invest a great deal of time into practices, games, and travel. Furthermore, injury is always a risk when playing a sport and can often lead to feelings of disappointment or even depression. Lastly, the pressure to win or perform well can be overwhelming for some students, potentially leading to anxiety or a negative experience overall. 

In conclusion, playing a sport can be an incredibly rewarding experience for students, as it helps develop a range of important life skills, allows for stress relief, and provides a sense of purpose. However, it important for students to weigh the costs to balance the risks, mentally prepare for the inevitable setbacks, and choose a sport that is enjoyable for them.",AI

Dear Principal,

I am writing to suggest the introduction of a program that would allow our students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities. Such programs would help give our students valuable insight into professional fields of interest and provide them with crucial job-skill training. 

For instance, we could encourage students to take field trips to local businesses, community events, and job fairs. This would give them a chance to learn from professionals in various industries about topics such as credit cards, finance, marketing, and customer service. Furthermore, these trips could also serve as an opportunity to explore and appreciate nature, as we could organize field trips to nearby parks, gardens, and nature preserves.

This program would benefit our students significantly. It would both broaden their knowledge of important social topics and give them a better sense of their career goals. It would also teach them key skills necessary to succeed in the workplace.

Thank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

In recent years, programs featuring older students helping younger students have been growing in popularity. These programs are designed to teach the younger generations a variety of skills, such as walking, social etiquette, and respect for others. It is believed that these programs not only provide educational opportunities, but also open job prospects and give participants the chance to explore talents they may never have realized before.

Moreover, programs like these could have a positive impact on the environment. For example, an increase in mentorship opportunities for younger generations may lead to increased understanding and appreciation for nature.

Many countries around the world have implemented similar programs tailored to their specific objectives. For instance, in Denmark, there's a program called udvekslingsstudent, in which older students from Danish high schools mentor their younger counterparts in both academics and extracurricular activities. In the United States, the Big Brothers Big Sisters program operates on a national level, pairing older students with at-risk youth in an effort to provide mentorship and guidance. 

All in all, programs involving older students helping younger students, provide a great benefit for all involved, as well as for the environment. With more research, more organizations and countries may deploy these programs in the future.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote, “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,” rings true in my own life and through studying the experiences of others. As an amateur soccer player, I never took my skills to the professional level, but if I chose to, I would have had to try something far beyond what I had already mastered. By pushing myself to my limits and rise to the challenge, I would have found a way to develop my skills even further and grow both on and off the field.

The same can be seen in the lives of other athletes. For example, LeBron James has continuously experimented and evolved his game since the day he joined the NBA. By not shying away from more difficult activities and taking on challenges, he has managed to peak as a four-time MVP and become one of the best players in the game’s history. Similarly, Kobe Bryant is also renowned for constantly pushing himself to the limit to become a better player; as a result, he achieved greatness and the opportunity to be gifted with five NBA championship rings. 

Likewise, celebrities outside the sports world have also credited their success to embracing challenge. Taylor Swift is a well-known example; she has moved past her country music roots and released multiple chart-topping pop albums, pushing her career to new heights. In her own words, “You will never grow unless you are willing to try something new. Sometimes that means taking risks, and sometimes it means outgrowing your comfort zone.”

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote holds true in our lives. We must be willing to solve puzzles, explore past boundaries, and take risks in order to grow and become the best versions of ourselves.",AI

Mandatory community service may be an effective tool in helping students to develop empathy and civic engagement. Through this, students will become familiar with the rewards of helping underserved populations, understanding the struggles of those less fortunate than themselves. Not only would this help students become more engaged citizens, but it would also create an avenue of connection between students of different backgrounds. Schools would benefit from having students with a more developed sense of responsibility and compassion, as well as increased camaraderie between students. The end result is young people with the ability to be more civically engaged in their future life and work, as well as more connected within a diverse community.",AI

Studies have demonstrated that having a positive attitude can make a drastic impact on a person's career, personal life, and relationships. In one example from 2018, a prominent business executive remarked that the most exciting part of his job was his positive attitude and his willingness to see challenges as opportunities rather than barriers. He was able to rise in the ranks of his industry and inspire others with his optimism and enthusiasm. 

The impact of developing a positive attitude is immense. People with positive attitudes often display higher self-confidence, increased motivation, improved concentration, and greater engagement with day-to-day tasks. Additionally, having a positive attitude can cultivate emotional resilience and help reduce stress and anxiety. 

Those looking to develop a more positive attitude can start by engaging in positive self-talk, being mindful of their thoughts and watching for signs of pessimistic thinking. Additionally, it can be useful to surround oneself with positive people, take breaks from negative influences, and focus on the positive aspects of oneself and one’s life. 

Although having a positive attitude has a plethora of benefits, there can indeed be downsides. Positive thinking can lead to denial of the realities of the world and gloss over potential dangers. To safeguard against this, it is essential to remember to stay grounded in reality and remain open to constructive criticism and negative information.",AI

In a world filled with countless sources of advice, it can be difficult to remain true to ourselves. It is so easy to conform to societal norms and expectations, and there is often a subtle, yet relentless, pressure to do so. Ralph Waldo Emerson was keenly aware of this fact, and famously professed that “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.” As such, it is vitally important to work individually in order to achieve great personal successes.

By working independently, we can discover and nurture our own interests and passions, in addition to developing our own unique sets of skills and capabilities. Through self-reflection and personal assessment, we can gain a better understanding of ourselves, both our strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, taking the time to engage in personal development activities can help us become more confident in our abilities and cultivate a better sense of self. 

Learning how to think, speak, and act for ourselves can also help us persevere even in the face of adversity. Rather than following the crowd, standing up for our beliefs and working toward our own individual goals can often be a source of pride and satisfaction. It can also open doors to many educational and professional opportunities that we may not have been able to pursue otherwise. 

Finally, valuing our individual identities and successes can make us all the more valuable in any team environment. After all, our unique perspectives and abilities can create synergy and bring success to any group. By working individually and finding the courage to be true to ourselves, we can truly make a positive impact on the people and world around us.",AI

Summer break has long been a staple of the school year for students and is widely viewed as an important facet of traditional education. On the one hand, there are many benefits to having a summer break. For example, after spending a long school year focusing their energies on their studies, the break allows students to rest and recuperate, helping them to re-energize and avoid burnout. Furthermore, students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education, such as volunteering, attending summer camps, or taking classes that their school doesn't offer. On the other hand, some argue that the gap in learning that can occur over a summer break results in a 'brain drain' which can set back students' academic performance upon returning to school each year. Studies have shown, however, that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that, overall, the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives.",AI

Making a good first impression is a key element of life, and is often what determines our success in various aspects, from making friends and maintaining relationships, to performing well in job interviews or school presentations. Our personality, actions and even the way we dress can all directly affect another person's view of us, and first impressions can be incredibly durable. 

Firstly, our personality can make someone feel comfortable and at ease or it can cause them to feel uneasy and intimidated. Being friendly, engaging, and having humility with a touch of assertiveness is often the best way to make a good first impression. Listening, being attentive, and having an energetic presence in conversations can show that we are putting forth effort to make an impact. 

Next, the actions we take can also go a long way in making a good first impression. Being polite, and having good manners can be beneficial, as well as showing gratitude and appreciation for any help or guidance received. Paying attention to personal hygiene should also not be overlooked. 

In addition, the clothes we wear can project an image and also make a lasting impression. Some situations call for more formal attire, like job interviews, which create an air of professionalism, while more casual settings may call for an outfit that can still be maintained to look neat while being comfortable. For example, a job interview would not be the best place to dress too casually as this could give the impression that you do not take the situation seriously. 

By being conscious of our personality, actions and clothing, we can make a good first impression in a number of scenarios. This can open up doors for us, both in terms of personal relationships and job opportunities. Good first impressions can also help us build trust with our peers or colleagues, which can have a positive effect within a team environment. Taking the time to make sure that our first impression is positive and memorable can pay off in the long run.",AI

The traditional 3-year high school program is an opportunity for many students to take advantage of the available resources and academic opportunities available in their school setting. But some students may choose to take classes in the summer or during evenings, for a variety of reasons. Taking courses during these times can be incredibly useful, but there are also some potential drawbacks, such as reduced access to resources. 

It is also important for high school students to make the most of their free time in an effective and productive manner. This is a great opportunity for students to invest in themselves and focus on their studies and extracurricular activities. Additionally, a high school diploma is an invaluable asset that can open many doors, and should not be taken lightly. Additionally, staying in school every single day provides a nurturing environment and the possibility of making invaluable connections.

Recent research has indicated that there are many potential benefits to having students engage in litter pickup and community service, such as fostering a stronger connection to the community and increasing social-emotional skills. These activities can even help to build leadership skills and reduce feelings of helplessness in teenagers. For parents, there are also peace of mind benefits. Knowing their teens are involved in community service activities with positive adult oversight can help foster mature decision-making. 

However, there are some risks associated with these activities. For example, some students may not be comfortable or feel safe doing such activities alone. In addition, these activities can become costly for cash-strapped school districts. Finally, they are labor-intensive tasks that administrators must manage to ensure safety and compliance with state guidelines. 

Given this research, it is clear that proactively engaging students in community service activities can certainly have a positive effect on a student's physical and mental health, and can create a stronger sense of camaraderie and involvement in their community. However, school administrators must put safety and cost considerations first, ensuring that both students and school staff are comfortable with the activities and that the added costs are covered.

The power of positive feedback from teachers should not be underestimated. As a student, being acknowledged for our hard work and achievements can inject us with a great sense of determination and self-confidence to strive for even greater heights. 

For example, when I was younger, I remember feeling so proud when my math teacher praised me for studying hard and for scoring well on my tests. This recognition kept me motivated to dive even deeper into the subject matter and tackle every challenging problem I encountered with enthusiasm. 

In addition to this, when a student knows that their teacher expects them to succeed, they will feel more confident in their abilities. With the right guidance and support, even intimidating tasks can be tackled confidently. As an example, a language teacher of mine once told me that she knew I could master a difficult syntax exercise if I put in enough effort. This pushed me to overcome my fear of failure and encouraged me to stay determined to complete the task.

When it comes to completing a task, people may have various preferences on whether to work in a group or alone. Working in a group can have many advantages; work can be shared more evenly, there is potential for more innovative ideas, and it can be a more social and enjoyable task. On the other hand, working alone can also have its own advantages such as allowing one to focus and stay focused on the job, and ensuring that all the responsibility is solely on the individual. 

When it comes to workload, working in a group has the potential to be more efficient due to sharing workloads and having several minds on the same task. On the other hand, when working alone, an individual will have to carry the entire workload and manage their own time and motivations. 

In terms of fun, working in a group has greater potential for being enjoyable and entertaining. Having people to work with and trade ideas off of can be seen as a benefit. Conversely, when one works alone, there is a greater chance for boredom and disconnection from the task. 

When it comes to ideas, working in a group allows for more creative freedom due to the helpful insight and ideas from others. There is also potential to build off of one another’s ideas. With having all the responsibility solely resting on one’s shoulders when working alone, there can be pressure that limits creative thinking. 

In terms of focus, working alone can be important as it allows the individual to settle in and stay on task without potential distractions from others. Conversely, when working in a group, it can be possible for one’s focus to be shifted and diluted as working in a group is an interactive process.

Cell phones have become invaluable tools, especially for students. While cell phones offer many advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to using them in the classroom for educational purposes.

On the positive side, cell phones can be used to help students keep up with course work and class notes. Not only do they provide a convenient way to take notes, but they can also be used to access educational websites, virtual classrooms, and online videos and articles. Additionally, cell phones can be used for communication purposes, such as group collaboration on group projects or critical discussions of course material.

Despite the potential advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. For instance, students may be distracted by their phones, leading to a decrease in information retention and overall learning. Additionally, if cell phones aren’t used correctly, it could potentially lead to decreased grades.

The idea that first impressions are almost impossible to change is common and pervasive in our society. It is often believed that what we feel and think upon our first encounter with something or someone will often remain with us for our entire relationship with them, and that changing those impressions is unlikely or impossible. 

Research has confirmed that first impressions are hard to shake, and are often more influential than we think. In one study, participants judged actors more harshly upon reading their negative reviews than they did reading their positive reviews. This indicates that, even if something or someone is reconsidered or rehabilitated, people can still be heavily influenced by their initial impressions. 

For example, if you meet someone new that you don't immediately like, it can be difficult to shake the feeling and give that person a fair chance. The same can be said for trying new food, shopping for clothing, visiting a place for the first time, and any other number of situations. 

I believe this statement holds a lot of truth. When we are presented with something new, our imaginations often draw upon snap judgments and preconceived ideas to make sense of it. We try to streamline our process of understanding by labeling things we don't know with identities we do recognize. Therefore, it is almost impossible to change that first impression.",AI

In El Salvador, and in many other countries, there is debate about reducing the amount of time required for high school completion from four years to three. On one hand, proponents cite the potential for students to enter college and the workforce earlier, allowing them to gain valuable experience sooner and reap the related benefits. Parents and teachers might view this as a way to ensure those students who wish to move onto higher education or a career have the ability to do so quickly. 

On the other hand, such a change may create an environment which shortcuts student development, reducing the amount of important life skills and lessons that a traditional four year high school experience provides. Students may not be ready to handle the greater responsibility, and without an adequate high school experience, may find themselves unprepared to adjust and succeed. 

In the long run, it is difficult to say whether reducing high school to three years is the right call. On the one hand, it may be beneficial to students who wish to move onto college or a job, but at the same time, it may mean they don’t have the skills necessary to succeed in those ventures. It may be better to keep high school as is - a four year process that allows individuals to gain and hone the skills and knowledge they need in order to move onto the next level of their lives.",AI

In Thomas Jefferson's famous quote, he suggests that ""much may be done if we are always on it nonstop.""

One of the primary benefits of implementing a curfew is that it increases safety. With a curfew in place, teens are discouraged from participating in risky activities such as taking part in criminal activities or driving with no license. Additionally, parents can be sure that their teens are in a safe place, and not in an environment where they are vulnerable to potential harm.

Another benefit of curfews for teenagers is that it can help build better relationships with their family. By enforcing a curfew, teens are given structure and their parents can be reassured that their children are safe. This can encourage communication and dialogue between families and help foster a strong bond between parents and their children. 

Overall, curfews can help provide teens with the structure and guidance they need to stay safe and healthy. It can help give parents peace of mind and keep teens away from risky behaviors and environments. By implementing a curfew, families can build better relationships and teenagers can gain a better understanding of responsibility.",AI

The effects of technology on society have been seen both positively and negatively. In the present, technology has allowed people to connect across physical boundaries in ways that were previously impossible. Social movements, including those focused on education reform and civil rights, have been effectively organized through technology. However, people’s heavy reliance on technology can also have serious consequences. Face-to-face interaction is becoming increasingly rare as people spend more time interacting with screens than with each other. This has been linked to aggressive behavior when people are told to limit their use of technology, as well as a general lack of social awareness and inability to interpret body language. 

In the past, technology had limited importance in society. People were largely disconnected and isolated from one another, hampered by the slow speed of communication and resulting misunderstanding of different cultures. As technology has advanced, it has given people the capability to exchange ideas and collaborate in ways that were not previously possible. 

To counterbalance the potential issues caused by technology, people should prioritize face-to-face interaction, foster empathy during conversations, and be mindful of their own technology use. It is important to understand that technology is only one tool that facilitates relationships; it should never replace human interaction.",AI

Working alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. For starters, it can be more efficient since you only have to consider your own needs and preferences. You won't have to waste time trying to work out group dynamics or compromise on decisions. 

Additionally, it can be beneficial for students to work independently. Working alone offers them the opportunity to learn to think critically and come up with their own solutions. It also instills a sense of autonomy and responsibility, as there are no other people to depend on to complete tasks. When faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group. 

Overall, I believe that it is often better for students to work alone than in a group. Independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.",AI

Education is a critical element of any high school student's future, and the importance of this education cannot be overstated. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some students to begin to identify their future career paths before completing their high school education. This premature commitment to one career can have major implications on a student's school work, mental health, and physical health. 

One of the most significant potential problems with committing to a career at a young age is that students may be unprepared or undereducated for their chosen profession. Without the necessary education or tools, students may be unable to succeed in their chosen careers, leading to feelings of frustration and diminished self-worth. Additionally, a premature commitment to a career can lead to unrealistic expectations, burn out, and a lack of motivation. 

It is important to provide students with the necessary guidance and support to ensure they have the best chance for success in their future endeavors. Encouraging students to take their time to explore and research various career paths can have positive impacts on their mental and physical health, as well as their school work. Providing students with the tools and resources to develop an individualized plan for their future career can help to ensure that they have the best possible chance of achieving success.",AI

Having a good attitude is incredible beneficial. It can help you become successful in life, make relationships stronger, make work tasks easier, and have a general feeling of wellbeing. It can also help you stay ahead in difficult times; strategies for maintaining a positive attitude during these times include manifesting positive thoughts, writing out your feelings in a journal, devising a plan to tackle the challenge head on, being grateful for the good things in life, and turning your negative thoughts into something positive. Being positive can be even more important during challenging times, as it can give you the inner strength and belief to do really great things. Smiling is such a simple thing but it can make such a huge difference; smiling can make other people around you happier too, and it can also help boost your own mood. People who achieve success often credit their positive attitude in helping them to succeed, and it can be inspiring to research some historical and modern-day examples of how having a good attitude can be a key factor in reaching success. Remaining true to yourself is also important; even though being positive is important, your own beliefs, feelings and opinions shouldn't be sacrificed to stay upbeat.",AI

Working in a group has been proven to be an efficient way of tackling tasks. This is because when working in a group, people can quickly build on ideas, use group synergies, and leverage the resources of every individual. Furthermore, it can help to promote creative and innovative solutions to problems, as group members come with different perspectives and backgrounds that can help to broaden the scope of the task at hand. 

On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to working in groups. Group projects require more management and can be difficult to manage when there is a lack of direction. Furthermore, group dynamics can be complicated, and it can be difficult to gather everyone on the same page. Additionally, the group approach does not always work for everyone, as some individuals work better when working by themselves. 

To illustrate the pros and cons of working within a group and as an individual, consider the example of a software development project. Working in a group can be advantageous in this instance as collaborating on a project can promote faster progress, since everyone can quickly build on ideas and work off each other. On the other hand, some people might prefer to work alone because they might feel more comfortable dominating the task and have more control over the overall outcome.

In conclusion, while there are clear advantages and disadvantages to both working in a group and working alone, it truly depends on the task and the individual’s preference as to which approach will be more effective.",AI

Cell phone use in the classroom has been a widely debated topic in recent years, with many schools implementing rules and regulations to govern their use. My opinion is that cell phones should be allowed in the classroom, as long as they are used responsibly and with the proper guidelines in place.

Cell phones can be a great way to access resources, both inside and outside the classroom. Students can use their phones to look up relevant information that can be used in class discussions. They can also take pictures or videos of their notes, which allows them to study more effectively at home or while on break. Additionally, phones can serve as a tool to stay organized; reminders, to-do lists, and alarms can help students keep on track and stay on task.

Furthermore, allowing cell phone usage can help foster relationships between students and teachers. By having access to their phones, students can contact their teachers with questions or for further help. This would lead to more meaningful collaborations and discussions between the two parties, leading to a greater understanding of the material being taught.

In conclusion, allowing cell phone use in the classroom is a reasonable decision. It can open up more possibilities in terms of learning, organization, and communication between students and teachers. Of course, guidelines need to be in place in order to ensure that cell phones are used responsibly and follow school policies. Nonetheless, the advantages of having cell phones in the classroom far outweigh any potential detriment.",AI

In our increasingly impersonal world, the power of small acts of kindness can often be forgotten. A single smile, a pat on the back and a few kind words can have a big impact on the lives of those around us. From family members and friends to colleagues and complete strangers, we can make a difference in the lives of others through small acts of kindness.

Small acts of kindness can help to reinforce positive connections between people. For example, when walking down the street, hold the door for the person behind you or say ‘good morning’ with a smile. Such simple gestures can go a long way in helping to strengthen a bond between two individuals, or even within a whole community.

No matter how small, paying it forward can brighten someone’s day. Showing appreciation for someone’s hard work or providing words of encouragement can leave them feeling good. One person’s positive reaction to a small act of kindness can help to spread joy to other people in their lives, and even around the world.

Therefore, it is clear that small acts of kindness can have a big impact on others. By remembering to take even the smallest opportunities to offer kindness and compassion, we can create a happier, more connected society.",AI

For example, an individual with a positive attitude may be more likely to seek out solutions and resources to help them push through difficult times. 

Overall, having a positive attitude is an important factor in achieving success. By building self-confidence, fostering quality relationships, and encouraging persistence, a positive attitude can help individuals reach their goals.",AI

Eating a balanced diet including foods such as healthy proteins, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, can help improve students' cognitive abilities, sharpen their memories, and give them the physical and mental energy needed for learning. Additionally, healthy meals can even help combat absenteeism, which can result in students falling behind in their classes.

Distance learning has been rapidly growing in popularity due to its many advantages, such as having classes available from the comfort of one's own home. It can also be very convenient for students with busy schedules or those who must travel, as learning is no longer affected by physical location. Additionally, students can make use of resources such as audio and video recordings to go back and review the material if needed. 

However, distance learning also has some disadvantages. One potential concern is student motivation and engagement with learning material; without physical contact to the teacher and fellow students, some students may feel less motivated or connected to their studies. There can be difficulties with the technology and possible miscommunication between students and teachers as well. Finally, online classes can also limit students’ access to materials or resources that can only be found in a physical classroom.",AI

When it comes to first impressions, it can be difficult to change them once they are made. We often make snap judgments of people and situations based on our initial instincts, especially if they present a negative view. That said, some have argued that it is indeed possible to change a negative first impression through sincere effort and dialogue. 

Proponents of this idea point to the value of communication and the power of trust. They suggest that by having honest conversations and demonstrating genuine care, a negative impression can be overturned. They claim that other factors such as body language and facial expressions can also help show someone that has been judged too harshly. 

On the other hand, some opponents argue that such an endeavor is ultimately fruitless, as our first instincts are difficult to shake. They claim that it is almost impossible to rewrite someone's opinion when a negative impression has been made. They argue that it is better to make a positive impression from the start in order to avoid any potential damage. 

Both sides of this argument offer valid points, and the reality is likely somewhere in the middle. While it is likely not easy to change a negative first impression, it is likely not impossible either. The importance of communication, trust, and demonstrating genuine care are key in any successful relationship, and it is possible to turn a negative first impression around if both parties are willing to be open and honest.",AI

Online classes have been gaining in popularity among high school students. Taking online classes from home can provide students with numerous advantages. They can study in their own time, from the comfort of their own home, and can have more control over the speed at which they complete their courses. This increases flexibility and allows students to pursue other activities with the extra time saved, such as participating in extracurricular activities or setting aside more time for leisure.

At the same time, there are drawbacks to taking online classes. Students may have limited access to tutors and course support. They may also miss out on the social and collaborative learning opportunities that traditional classrooms provide. Furthermore, students may lack the motivation and self-discipline to successfully complete an online course.

For example, a student may take an online math course that allows them to complete courses in their own time. This allows them to schedule additional time for extracurricular activities or leisure, such as joining a local sports team or exploring new hobbies. However, they may also be at risk of failing the course if they lack the necessary discipline and self-motivation.",AI

In life-threatening situations, it is important to stay as safe as possible. To help with this, here are some tips for five high school grade students. When faced with an intruder in a lockdown situation, students should look for objects to throw that are heavier than their textbooks. This can include heavy lamps or furniture. When faced with a fire drill, students should quickly gather any valuables or necessary items, then proceed calmly and quickly to the nearest exit. When an earthquake hits, students should stay low to the ground and move away from any heavy furniture or objects that could fall. Additionally, if students are in a building, it is important for them to cover their head and neck with their hand or a jacket until the shaking stops. No matter what situation students find themselves in, it's important to stay calm and always follow emergency procedures.",AI

Throughout this essay, I will explore the importance of trusting people, experiences where my trust has been broken, and how to identify bad influences. 

When I was younger, I made a mistake of accepting a bad friendship with someone who pushed me to make decisions I was uncomfortable with. Despite their bad influence, I trusted them and allowed myself to be controlled for fear of losing them. I soon learned that this person had lied to me and was not the friend I thought they were. I lost more than just a friend, but my trust and faith in someone else. This experience made me realize the importance of being able to trust other people and not succumb to changing just because it's difficult to stay firm about who you are. 

It's essential to determine if a person is a good influence or a bad influence. This can be done by assessing how someone makes you feel, what kind of advice they give you, and how they react when you refuse to do something they ask you to do. Good influences are encouraging, supportive, and understand when you make the decision to be true to yourself. On the other hand, bad influences are often manipulative, disloyal, and quick to be dishonest when things don't go their way. 

I learned the importance of trusting people, but also verifying if they will be a positive or negative presence in your life. It's not wrong to be kind and have faith in those around you, but it's also important to know your limits, pay attention to the red flags, and be confident in your decisions and beliefs.",AI

Generic_Name had always been an independent learner who rarely consulted others for advice. So when faced with a big decision — like deciding on a college — Generic_Name typically hopped online, performed their own research, and then made a decision without ever seeking the counsel of anyone else. 

However, this often lead to decisions that weren’t the best for Generic_Name in the long run. When Generic_Name moved to a new city, there were a lot of considerations that one person alone couldn’t have anticipated. Generic_Name began to recognize the value of seeking multiple opinions in order to make better decisions that would bring lasting success. 

One of the primary benefits of seeking multiple opinions is being able to receive different perspectives from other people. External advice can provide guidance that was not previously considered. People with different experiences often offer solutions that couldn’t have been achieved by an individual. For instance, when Generic_Name decided to start a business, they were able to get advice from an individual who had successfully started their own business ten years prior. This person shared their insights and experiences on the best business model to use, and it ultimately saved a great deal of time and money for Generic_Name. 

Seeking multiple opinions also gives one more than one option to choose from. Instead of blindly accepting a single option, Generic_Name found more solutions when they decided to turn to their family and friends.

One of the greatest educational benefits of taking an art, music, or drama class as an elective in school is the development of creativity. By engaging in creative activities such as painting, writing music, or performing on stage, students acquire skills that go beyond the traditional academic curriculum and can help them become more creative thinkers. Additionally, taking art, music, and drama classes can help improve a student's academic performance, as research has shown that students who participate in creative activities tend to score higher on tests, think more critically, and have better problem solving skills.

In addition to academic performance, taking art, music, and drama classes can provide students with practical skills and knowledge that are beneficial for college and career prospects. Knowledge learned in these classes such as how to read and interpret music, create and understand art, and perform and interpret a dramatic script can be useful for college and job applications. Furthermore, collaborative activities such as ensemble performance and group theatres can help students gain important interpersonal skills such as teamwork and leadership that are beneficial for college and professional endeavors.

By taking art, music, and drama classes, students can gain an in-depth understanding of the various aspects of these creative pursuits. This knowledge can be applied to various aspects of their lives, such as studying, developing creativity, and providing them with the opportunity to pursue their interests in a safe, structured environment.

In today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. From the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. Unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health.

Recent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face-to-face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. But why is that? Simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. Without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. Furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch--they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. This disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others.

My own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well-being. When I was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction I had was through a laptop or phone screen, and I really started to feel the negative effects of it. I found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and I often felt lonely and isolated. It was only when I was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in-person that I was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves. And while the use of technology will always be necessary in our lives, we must remember to prioritize real human interaction as an essential component of our health and well-being.",AI

As an artist, Michelangelo famously said: “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” This resonates with me, as I can think of multiple times in my life where I have set my goals too low and have forgotten to reach for the stars, as it were. For example, when I was on my high school's soccer team, I was content to be a middle-of-the-pack player, when I had the potential to be one of the best players. Similarly, while looking for a job after college, I was all too happy to take the first offer that came my way, rather than researching other opportunities that could have made for a challenging, yet rewarding career.

As time passed and I set my goals higher, I began to see the positive repercussions of this decision. On the soccer team, I pushed myself to excel on the field, eventually becoming team captain in my senior season. In the professional world, I chose to take the time and actively explore new opportunities that have let me grow as an individual and be successful as a professional. Both of these present a clear link between Michelangelo’s words and my own experiences. With any effort we put forth in life, we must challenge ourselves to set goals that will push our limits and boundaries, so that we can reach our maximum potential.

As seen in my own life, Michelangelo’s words serve as a reminder that setting our sights too low is a greater danger than failing to reach an ambitious goal. To quote the artist himself, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” By seeking to challenge one’s self and remaining ambitious, a person can submit themselves to a path that may be difficult, but will ultimately lead to success in the long run.",AI

Winston Churchill once famously stated, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” Churchill's words provide a great reminder of the importance of failure in achieving success. Failure is essential to success because it helps us to develop skills, to learn resilience, and to become better problem-solvers. 

Take, for example, Thomas Edison's lightbulb. Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” After thousands of trials and errors, Edison eventually achieved success. Had he given up at the first few attempts of failure, he would have never created the lightbulb, one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the late 19th century. 

Similarly, the film industry is filled with stories of those who found success after a history of failure. Steven Spielberg was turned down by the University of Southern California’s film school three times, and was rejected from Universal Studios numerous times before making his first feature-length film. 

These examples demonstrate that Churchill's statement holds true: it is only through the courage to continue, even in the face of failure, that success can be achieved.",AI

When it comes to deceptive behaviors, one example is when someone changes their appearance or behavior in order to impress or get something from someone else. For example, if a person is trying to get a job, they may dress more professionally than their usual style, in order to leave a better first impression on their potential employer. Additionally, when individuals feel left out of a group, their behavior can change drastically in order to impress or be accepted by the group, and it can be evident through their tone, body language or even words used. Furthermore, first impressions may give you a good indication of a person's trustworthiness and ability. When observing someone for the first time, the nonverbal behavior, such as facial expressions and physical movements, can be a good indication of a person's true intentions.

Art, music, and drama classes are commonly offered in schools, but some people debate whether they should be electives or required for students of all ages. While these classes have the potential to spark creativity in some students, forcing students to take them can have unpleasant and even detrimental results. 

Forcing students to take classes in the Arts can be a challenging burden for those who struggle with creative expression or don’t have an interest in them. For instance, some students may become easily overwhelmed in an art class as they try to master the mechanics of painting, drawing, or sculpting. Similarly, music classes may feel intimidating if students feel like they are constantly being judged on their performance and can’t seem to get the rhythm or notes right. As for drama classes, the pressure of improvisation or memorizing lines in front of an audience can cause some students to dread the class. 

Allowing students to pick their own classes in the Arts makes more sense. That way, those with an interest or aptitude for a particular class can pursue it, while those who don’t have any inclination for the subject can find classes more suited to their interests. For example, if a student loves taking pictures, they may be more inclined to take a photography class than a painting class. 

Ultimately, mandating art, music, and drama classes can be difficult for some students and impractical for many. For this reason, it’s important to allow students to choose their classes, so they can pursue subjects and activities they find enjoyable and engaging. Doing so is beneficial for the students and the school in the long-run, as it increases the likelihood of students succeeding in their chosen electives, while also giving the school a better indication of student interests.",AI

""Determine never to be idle"" is a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and it is a valuable saying that resonates with today’s society, where it often feels like there is not enough time in the day for all we need to do. How can we as a society apply this quote and reduce our collective idleness? By committing ourselves to utilizing every moment to the best of our abilities, we can ensure that our time and energy are being used in an effective and productive way. 

For instance, one individual who was determined not to be idle was Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard but still managed to create one of the most successful and recognizable technology companies in history. Instead of wasting his time being idle, Gates used his ambition and determination to create something meaningful with his time, and today his success serves as an example for others.

Those who are idle and think that inactivity serves a purpose are not only not determined to better their lives, but they are also not planning for the future. This means that a lack of passion can lead to stunted intellectual growth and missed opportunities.

Numerous studies have shown that after school homework clubs are beneficial for both students and their surrounding schools. These clubs provide a safe and secure environment for students to complete their school work and develop their study habits. 

For the students, homework clubs offer a tailored learning experience designed to help them enhance their academic skills and potential. By having access to a tutor or mentor, students are given the chance to receive individual support outside of the classroom. Learning in this manner can help students gain confidence and think more deeply about the material they are studying. This can lead to improved grades and a better understanding of the material. Additionally, after school homework clubs encourage collaboration and problem-solving skills in a supervised environment, enhancing students' social and teamwork abilities. 

Homework clubs also provide further benefits for the school as a whole. By providing this service, schools demonstrate to their students that they are invested in their future and want to see everyone succeed. This gives the students a sense of trust and belonging, making them more likely to have a positive outlook towards education. Eagerness to learn can spread to their peers, creating a stronger learning environment in the school. In addition, after school homework clubs may lead to an increase in parental engagement in the student's learning. With access to school-provided lessons and resources, parents can more easily follow their child's progress and assist them when needed. 

Overall, after school homework clubs are immensely beneficial for both students and their surrounding schools. With the tailored learning experience, students have a chance to improve their study habits while the school increases parental engagement. This can lead to successful academic outcomes and improved grades.",AI

A policy allowing students to use their cellphones during lunch and free time has both benefits and drawbacks. On the positive side, it can be an effective way to help students stay connected to family and friends, especially for those who live far away or don't have access to other forms of communication. Additionally, it can be a great tool for students to access educational resources, such as audio podcasts, news articles, and educational videos, during lunch or other free time. 

On the negative side, being able to access social media or play games during lunch can be a distraction from the purpose of taking a break from the school day. Additionally, unstructured access to technology can led to an increase in cyberbullying or unwise internet use. It is important for schools to set rules around the use of cellphones and have a strict policy of consequences for inappropriate behavior.",AI

Making music, drama, and art classes compulsory for students can offer many advantages. It is a great opportunity for students to learn to express themselves, explore their creativity, and develop the ability to think critically and artistically. Learning music, drama, and art can also help students better understand different cultures and viewpoints, and add to their overall educational experience. 

On the other hand, some students may not have an interest in these subjects, and making them compulsory may make them feel unmotivated and annoyed. Additionally, if these classes are not taught in an engaging manner, students may not be able to gain any meaningful knowledge from them. 

Overall, I believe that music, drama, and art classes should be included as part of the curriculum but not made compulsory. If students have a genuine interest in these subjects, they should be encouraged to pursue them further. This would help them get the most out of the classes and keep them engaged, while those who would prefer to avoid them should be allowed to do so.",AI

When it comes to classrooms, having teachers design projects for students can be just as beneficial as having students come up with their own ideas. In my experience, having a teacher-designed project gave me a starting point to expanding my knowledge and learning. Instead of having to think of an idea from scratch, I had a framework to work off of – the challenge was figuring out ways to take that project and make it my own. Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the project, I could focus on understanding the concepts I was presented with, and use that knowledge to come up with my own creative solutions or ideas. 

Research has also suggested that when teachers structure and guide learning, it leads to better academic outcomes for students. A study published in the International Journal of Research and Reviews in Applied Sciences showed that when students were given guidance, structure and support, their overall learning experience improved. Specifically, when teachers designed projects, students reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their learning environment. 

In conclusion, having teachers design projects provides many benefits for students that they wouldn’t experience if they were designing them on their own. It is an effective way to guide student learning and understanding, while still allowing students to express their creativity and come up with their own solutions.",AI

In recent years, an increasing number of students have brought cell phones to school. This has created a debate around the issue of allowing students to use these devices during passing periods and lunch time. On the one hand, cell phones can provide convenience, lowering the cost of communication between families and providing a connection to emergency services should the need arise. On the other hand, allowing students to use their phones during passing period and lunch time can be a source of distraction, as well as a challenge to teacher authority.

From a convenience perspective, cell phones allow students to stay in touch with their families more easily and cheaply than ever before. This can provide peace of mind to both parents and students, as parents can be assured that their children are safe and that they are able to contact them quickly in the event of an emergency. In addition, cell phones can provide access to educational tools, such as instructional videos and online resources that can supplement a student's studies. 

However, allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time can lead to distractions such as playing games, texting, or social media surfing. This can interfere with learning, as it can take students’ attention away from their academics. In addition, allowing students to use cell phones can be a challenge to teacher authority, as it can be difficult for teachers to ensure that students are not using their phones during class time. 

Ultimately, a decision must be made about allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time. While there are clear advantages to allowing cell phones, such as convenience and possible access to educational resources, there are also risks such as distractions and challenging teachers’ authority. Therefore, these pros and cons must be weighed carefully as administrators determine the best policy for their school.",AI

Attending a high school program that offers students the opportunity to graduate in three years versus four years presents both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, a three-year program provides students with the opportunity to jumpstart college or university studies, and potentially move quickly into their career. It also gives students more flexibility in their schedule, allowing them to take extra courses or pursue extracurricular activities in their fourth year of study. On the other hand, students miss out on the social opportunities provided by the fourth year of high school studies, which can give them an advantage when applying for college or for a job. Additionally, some students may not be ready for the academic and emotional demands of a three-year program due to not having the maturity to handle the rigors of such a program.

While there have been more traditional ways of taking classes throughout educational history, the emergence of online courses and virtual video conferencing have made it possible for busy students and those living far away from their desired schools to benefit from quality education. These classes present more convenience to those who have a baby or who need to go to work, allowing them to complete their coursework at their own pace and in the comfort of their own homes. 

In an online setting, students have the advantage of greater flexibility and being able to work around other commitments. While there may be specific deadlines for assignments, students can utilize the convenience of online to their advantage and submit work when it's most convenient for them. Additionally, online coursework provides the ability to access material from multiple resources, giving students a more in-depth understanding of the course.

The benefits of taking music, drama, or art classes in school are numerous. Art classes can help students practice an important form of self-expression, while music and drama classes can boost confidence and cultivate creative problem-solving and communication skills. 

However, some students may not want or be able to take these classes for various personal reasons, such as having limited free time or feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve. When parents force their children to take such classes, the students often lose their motivation to perform, and may grow to resent the activity as a result. 

It is often argued that making these classes compulsory could lead to a loss in the authenticity of the activities being taught. Students may lack an enthusiasm for learning the skills required for the class, and this can have a negative effect on their interest and the quality of their work.

One of the primary differences between a four-year high school program and a three-year high school program is the amount of time available for students to study. A four-year program contains more time for students to delve deeply into subject areas, while a three-year program might offer more opportunities to complete electives or take additional courses, thus potentially leading to improved college readiness. Another consideration is the impact of taking a break in the summer months, which four-year students will experience while three-year students will not. Summer break can offer students a much needed respite from their studies, but it can also lead to loss of knowledge for those who do not engage in learning activities during this period. Furthermore, four-year students will have an additional year to explore extracurriculars or participate in programs like internships, but three-year students could, in theory, have more flexibility with their course schedule to fit in nonacademic pursuits.

Having a positive attitude is not only beneficial to our overall well-being, but it also impacts our personal lives and careers. Here are three reasons why having a positive attitude should be a priority: 

First, cultivating a positive attitude promotes better physical health. Those with a positive outlook are less likely to experience stress-related physical problems, such as headaches and muscle tension. Additionally, research has found that positive thinking contributes to an improved sense of self-worth, which can inspire a healthier lifestyle.

Secondly, having a positive attitude can improve our relationships with those around us. By approaching situations with optimism, we can become better communicators and problem solvers. We are also less likely to come off as defensive or aggressive -- traits that can make it difficult to form trusting relationships. 

Finally, with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be successful in our studies and careers.

It is often said that first impressions are everything, and they can have a powerful influence on how we view another person. But is it always the case that first impressions are accurate? The truth is, first impressions can change after we get to know a person. This has been supported both by personal experiences and factual evidence.

On a personal level, I have found that sometimes my first impressions of someone have proven to be inaccurate after getting to know them better. A few years ago, I met someone who immediately rubbed me the wrong way. On the surface, they seemed cocky and rude. But as I got to know them better, this person eventually became one of my closest friends. It turns out, they were actually quite humble and kind, and I was glad that I decided to give them a chance despite my first impressions.

This idea has also been supported by academic research. In a 2012 study, researchers asked participants to watch brief videos of strangers and form an impression. The study found that the more information participants had about the persons in the video, the more their first impression changed. These findings suggest that the more interaction we have with someone, the more our initial impression of them may change.

Overall, it appears that first impressions are not always an accurate indicator of someone's personality or character. This is why it is important to look beyond the surface of any person and get to know them better. All too often, a knee-jerk reaction to a first impression can lead to judgments that are not entirely valid and might be better described as an educated guess.",AI

Attitude has a profound impact on the success of an individual's life journey. When approached with a positive attitude, the opportunities come in increasing abundance, helping to ensure that the individual’s success reaches its ultimate potential. When approached with a negative attitude, the individual’s self-destructive attitude takes over the entire environment, have a negative effect on the individual’s life and those around them. 

One of the most effective ways to ensure a positive attitude is to set realistic goals. This not only provides validation of where the individual is currently but also provides a roadmap to success that is manageable and achievable. With this roadmap in mind, it is important to stay focused on those realistic goals and to maintain an attitude that is realistic,yet optimistic. Positivity breeds success, setting someone up for the long-term success that they orignally sought out to reach. 

Making the conscious decision to stay positive enables someone to face difficult situations better and handle the roller coaster ride of life’s waves with grace. It also helps to take each step of the journey with more enthusiasm and passion, something that leads to better focus and greater self-belief. Having the right attitude also contributes to having a more meaningful life beyond material gains. 

Attitude is also an attitude that can be controlled. It can be trained through regular practice of self-care and being mindful of day-to-day thoughts and emotions. Establishing a practice of gratitude also helps to foster an attitude of optimism which is essential to achieve success in life. It is important to make sure our attitude remains positive and stays true to our values.

Relying on others is an essential part of life. We often don't realize the importance of relying on others until faced with a challenge that we cannot handle on our own. This doesn’t mean that complete dependence on another person is ideal. Instead, we should strive for a balance of individual action and cooperation.

Individuals should strive for independence and self-sufficiency. These are valuable traits, and often, they can carry a person through difficult times. But relying on others gives us the support we need to tackle even greater challenges. It allows us to pool resources and ideas, expanding the range of possibilities. Working with others forces us to think outside the box and break away from our limited perspectives.

More importantly, relying on others helps us to build meaningful relationships. We can learn from their experiences and share our own, creating an environment of trust, encouragement, and understanding. Without these connections, individuals can be left feeling isolated and disempowered. 

In the end, knowing when to lean on others and when to be independent is the key to a fulfilling and successful life.

Extending school hours has become a controversial issue among educators, parents, and students alike. Supporters of this plan argue that it would offer students more quality time to focus on their studies, develop skills, and interact with their instructors. However, there are also those who argue that extending school hours would put too much stress on students and disrupt their already tight schedules. 

The pros of extending school hours are numerous. Firstly, students would have more time to focus on their academics. Longer school hours make it possible for teachers to spend more time exploring complex topics and for students to build deeper understanding of course material. Secondly, extending school hours could offer students the opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities. With more time available, students could participate in councils and activities that promote problem-solving and teamwork. Lastly, it could give students an opportunity to interact more with teachers. Spending more time with instructors outside of the classroom can help create a closer, more meaningful, student/teacher relationship.

On the other hand, longer school hours could also result in stressful conditions for students. Oftentimes, already tight student/family schedules could be disrupted due to the added time commitment. In addition, spending more time in the classroom puts more strain on students who are already trying to balance school with other responsibilities such as sports teams, internships, and jobs. Lastly, some argue that extended hours could extend to a loss of valuable sleep, resulting in poorer learning outcomes.

In conclusion, there are some valid arguments both for and against extending school hours. However, when weighing the pros and cons, it is important to take all factors into consideration and ensure that any potential policy changes are in the best interests of all involved.",AI

Professional soccer in the late 1800s required immense skill and hard work to achieve success. Players worked tirelessly perfecting their techniques and detail-oriented skills while simultaneously developing their endurance. Communication was also imperative to the success of the game during this period. The ability to effectively communicate planned plays and strategize with teammates could make or break a team.

To demonstrate the significance of both talent and effort, I'd like to use the example of a fictional soccer player, Alex Hunter. Alex was a naturally talented player, possessing the skills necessary to lead his team. Although he was gifted in the game, his drive and determination allowed him to work just as hard as his teammates. Thanks to the combination of his natural talents and hardworking attitude, Alex and his teammates achieved success on the field.

Extending the school day has been a hot topic of debate in many countries for a variety of reasons. On the one hand, some research suggests that by adding two hours to the school day, students could be exposed to a greater variety of topics while engaged in directed learning, and would have more time to explore their individual interests. On the other hand, the additional hours spent in the classroom could be seen as an unnecessary burden, with student wellbeing and learning outcomes suffering due to fatigue and boredom. In order to more fully understand the potential implications of such a change, it is essential to consider the educational context in which this decision would be made. Factors such as the age of the students and the quality of instruction being provided, as well as the availability of resources and support structures, must all be taken into account.

One of the potential benefits of changing the school lunches to healthier options is that it could promote better health outcomes for all students, regardless of race, religion, or body type. Fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods can be better for students’ physical health, and many nutritionists recommend more plant-based proteins like beans and quinoa when possible. However, some students may feel excluded if there are fewer foods that fit in with their religious or cultural backgrounds. To combat this, schools can offer a variety of foods from around the globe, taking into account dietary guidelines from different religions and culture. This can encourage students a chance to explore and sample dishes that they may not have had access to before, while also promoting a more inclusive and accepting environment. In addition, vegetarian and vegan options should be made available to ensure that all students have access to a healthy and nutritious meal.

The power of action is undeniable. Doing something, no matter how small, can often lead to greater accomplishments. Consider the importance of taking the first step in any endeavor. Whether it’s finally getting that new project off the ground, launching a business, or simply cleaning out the garage, it all starts with taking action. And the more action we take, the higher the likelihood of achieving success. 

When we remain idle, our options become limited. We can sit and dream about what we want and even plan our next move, but until we get up and do something, those dreams will remain just that - dreams. Oftentimes, the solutions we seek exist in plain sight, but we will never find them if we’re not actively looking. 

Taking action also helps us face our fears. For many of us, it is the fear of failure that holds us back. When we remain idle, we can come up with all kinds of excuses as to why we can’t do something. Doing something helps us view our fears and challenge them head on. We may not always succeed, but by taking action, we at least have a chance of success.

By managing the types and number of extracurricular activities students are involved in, schools can ensure students receive all the necessary information to decide on an optimal course for their future. For example, rather than having students commit to a single activity or hobby, a carefully managed balance of multiple extracurricular activities helps students explore all potential interests, make informed decisions, and find the perfect match to their academic career path. This in turn increases their chances of success and significantly improves their overall student experience.",AI

    One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. 

Rather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.",AI

Technological innovations have completely transformed the way that people work, communicate, and shop. From the smartphone to self-driving cars, technology has rapidly developed and expanded our capabilities and spatial reach. Technology allows us to stay connected with friends and family, no matter how far they are away. Online shopping has allowed people to purchase virtually anything all from the comfort of their home. 

Technology has also enabled people to be more efficient in their tasks and activities. Automation has made it possible to do mundane tasks in a fraction of the time as before. It is also opening up opportunities to learn new skills in real-time that would have otherwise required formal education. Technology can provide rapid access to resources, information, and the latest news in an instant.

However, there are some potential negative impacts of technology that should be taken into consideration. Excessive usage can lead to addiction, where users are unable to switch off or take necessary breaks. Information overload can lead to information fatigue, and lack of physical exercise as a result of device usage is known to have hazardous effects on our health. 

Overall, technology and science have been responsible for a number of beneficial advances in our society. However, when used in excess and with little self-control it can have a negative influence on our lives. As technology continues to evolve and progress, it is imperative to consider the consequences of its use, and to ensure it is used responsibly and in the right context.",AI

Attending school and studying online both offer different advantages and disadvantages to students. One of the primary benefits of attending school is the social interaction; students are able to make friends in class, have more interactions with teachers and other adults in the school, and form relationships with their classmates. This educational environment is also beneficial when it comes to developing responsibility; while at school, students also learn how to be accountable for themselves and others when it comes to academic commitments, following directions, and paying attention in class. Additionally, attending school ensures that students get a healthy diet, with access to nutritious meals throughout the day.

On the other hand, studying online and taking online classes allows students to work at their own pace, learn on their own terms, and follow an educational path that best fits their individual needs. Online learning provides more flexibility for students, as they can attend classes whenever they are available and not have to worry about staying on a specific schedule. Additionally, online students may have more resources and course material available, as they can access them from their own devices.

Although both options provide great opportunities, the best option for students will depend on their individual needs and preferences. Attending school has its advantages, particularly with its social aspect, while studying online provides more freedom and flexibility. Choosing the most beneficial option needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis, as both options have their own unique pros and cons.",AI

Taking into consideration the potential advantages of an extra hour and a half to the school day, research has been conducted to develop an action plan for successful implementation. Data from a recent survey of stakeholders in the education sector showed 84% of those polled, including teachers, students, and administrators, expressed support of the idea.

The extra hour and a half could be composed of two 45-minute blocks of instructional time and one 30-minute block of time for recreation/socialization. This would provide additional time for group learning activities, engaging lectures, and experiential learning opportunities for students, as well as allow teachers to better meet academic demands. Furthermore, the extended recess would allow for physical exercise, social interaction, and more time outdoors, thereby promoting healthier student bodies and positive psychological wellbeing.

An action plan to ensure successful implementation of the extra hour and a half includes engaging with stakeholders to discuss plans, incorporating additional methods of instruction to efficiently and effectively use the time available, exploring funding and staffing sources, and monitoring and adjusting the plan as necessary. We believe that this action plan could be a valuable resource for schools interested in adding an extra hour and a half to the school day.",AI

The potential consequences of disobeying curfew for teenagers can be severe depending on the city or state where the curfew is being enforced. If the curfew is established by law, then it is punishable by law. Depending on the severity of the offense, legal penalties can range from fines to jail time. For those who live in a city or state that does not have a statutory curfew, breaking curfew can still result in consequences from the parents such as restricted access to cars and phones, fewer privileges, or grounding. As an alternative to legal penalties, parents can choose to impose other forms of discipline such as discussion, restriction of privileges, or other punishments.

Having a positive attitude is often touted as a key to success, but is it really the only factor to consider in life? It is true that having an optimistic outlook has a range of benefits – it can make it easier to accomplish goals and build relationships – but there are also times when maintaining a neutral, or even negative, attitude is more relevant.

Going in with an overly-positive mindset can be counterproductive, as it may lead to unrealistic expectations and a frustrating lack of progress. With this situation, an individual may be too eager to believe that any obstacles can be easily overcome, when in reality additional challenges may be encountered. On the other hand, adopting a more practical and measured approach, one that does not involve ignoring potential roadblocks or issues, can allow an individual to remain calm and remain focused on their goal.

Having a negative attitude can also be damaging, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and disheartened. A pessimistic attitude is unlikely to lead to fruitful endeavors, as it can prevent an individual from taking risks or challenging themselves in worthwhile ways. Additionally, a pessimistic outlook can also tarnish relationships, making it difficult to form meaningful connections with those around you.

Ultimately, having the right balance between optimism and pessimism is key to finding success in life. It is important to recognize the potential risks and difficulties, but also have an underlying positive outlook which encourages progress. Identifying and creating for yourself a realistic, positive attitude which remains open minded to all possibilities is the best approach for finding success in any endeavour.",AI

Throughout life, first impressions are incredibly important. The way a person is initially perceived based on looks, body language, and attitude all play a significant role in how they are initially viewed. However, while looks and body language are the ones that are usually noticed first, it is ultimately the attitude and communication skills of a person that can completely change a first impression. 

When it comes to looks, it is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Finding someone attractive or not can depend upon someone's individual opinion or preferences. However, a person's fashion sense, the clothes and accessories they wear, and even their grooming habits, can also change the way they are perceived. By making straightforward changes in all of these areas, one's initial impression can be improved. 

A person's personality may also be a factor in changing a first impression because it is often easier to see a person's true nature once conversation has been established. Someone who is animated and interesting can be much more attractive than someone who is shy and withdrawn. If a person can show that they are genuinely sociable, open-minded, and well-rounded, this can often counter any experience or appearance that was negative at first. 

Finally, communication skills play a big part in how a first impression is perceived. The ability to articulate one's thoughts and communicate clearly can be a very powerful tool in making a positive impression. It is usually impossible to hide questionable communication skills, so by honing this aspect of one's personality, it is possible to make a lasting impression. 

Therefore, through one's looks, personality, and communication, a first impression can and should be managed so that an individual can make the best possible impact when meeting someone for the first time. By making just a few minor changes, a lasting impression can be left on another person that can outshine any first impression based on initial appearances.",AI

It is therefore essential to have an understanding of one's own character traits, as this can lead to improved confidence and personal fulfillment. In conclusion, the origin and influence of character traits is an extremely relevant matter that can have far-reaching implications in regards to a person's life and identity.",AI

Cell phones have become an integral part of today's society, and the different perspectives on whether they should be allowed in the classroom can spark debate. On one hand, allowing students to use their phones in the classroom can be beneficial, since students can access educational resources online, easily contact family members or friends, or take notes digitally. However, cell phones can also be a major distraction, as students may play games or browse social media sites, leading to wasted class time and potentially distracting other students. 

In my opinion, there should be a balance between allowing the use of cell phones and banning them. Classroom rules should be established regarding cell phone use -- for instance, permitting students to use them for taking notes during lectures, or for researching information online, while also forbidding their use during other activities, such as discussions or group work. When used properly, cell phones have the potential to be very beneficial in a classroom setting; however, it is also important to consider the potential for distraction, in order to ensure that students remain focused on their school work.",AI

Individuality is a concept that has long been celebrated and valued. In today's world, being an individual is more important than ever before. It is a way of embracing our uniqueness and expressing ourselves fully. This is why my parents have always encouraged me to be an individual. From an early age, they taught me the importance of making my own decisions and developing my own ideas.

As a young adult, I have taken this philosophy more seriously, particularly in my professional life. When I considered starting my own business, I had to make the individual decision of whether it was the right move for me. Ultimately, I chose to take a risk and follow my dreams. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience and has taught me how powerful it can be to make individual decisions.

Many authors have explored the concept of individuality in their works. Dan Brown's novel ""The DaVinci Code"" is a great example of this, featuring an individual's quest for the truth. His literary adaptation of ""Maria Magdalena"" similarly focuses on an individual's journey towards self-discovery. Even when referring to historical events, the idea of individuals impacting the course of history is evident, through figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.

In conclusion, individuality is something to be celebrated and embraced. In today's world, making individual decisions and going our own way can be frightening, but it is ultimately very rewarding.

Imagination has the power to open up a world of possibilities. It can take us to places knowledge may not be able to go, allowing us to think outside the box and explore uncharted territory. It has the ability to ignite creativity and inspire us to do extraordinary things. For example, some of the greatest technological breakthroughs of our time, from the light bulb to the smartphone, began as mere figments of someone’s imagination. It has also helped countless entrepreneurs take their businesses to the next level, allowing them to identify opportunities and draw up innovative solutions that have achieved unparalleled success. 

While knowledge is also important in its own right, it primarily builds upon existing ideas. In comparison, imagination allows us to conceive entirely new ideas and generate pioneering solutions. It encourages us to be more inquisitive, curious, and visionary. It gives us the courage to take risks and propel us to strive for excellence.

Making a positive first impression is immensely important when meeting someone for the first time. It can have a powerful effect on the success or failure of any relationship, be it with a colleague, friend, or romantic partner. A positive first impression can lead to trust, successful collaborations, and meaningful connections, while a negative first impression can quickly ruin an opportunity or sour a relationship.

Take job opportunities, for example. A potential employer base much of their decisions on an applicant’s first impression. Studies have shown that applicants who are well groomed, confident with their communication, and present themselves with respect and enthusiasm are much more likely to be hired. The same principle applies when looking for new friends or romantic partners. People tend to be attracted to confidence and enjoy talking to someone who communicates clearly.

When it comes to establishing good relationships with peers, a positive first impression goes a long way. People who are kind, calm, and welcoming are more likely to be liked and respected. It's almost a guarantee that an individual who exudes confidence and respect will make a better impression than someone who exudes anger and distrust.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” Emerson's words provide the backbone to the idea that mastering something important is essential in order to succeed in life. Oftentimes, it can be overwhelming by the amount of advice one may receive from friends, family, and colleagues in regards to what direction life should take. Instead of focusing on someone else's opinion, it is important to focus on one""s true passions and dreams. Success can be achieved by pursuing something that sparks joy.

Take for example the success story of Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, who pursued his passion in computer science and declined a lucrative job at Microsoft. He followed his dream and his success is now admired by people all around the world. As the saying goes, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.” Unfortunately, some people may try to bring us down and discourage us from pursuing our dreams. Negative people will likely stand in our way and with the right amount of resilience and focus, it is possible to push past the doubts and move forward.

Though unsolicited advice is often difficult to process, it is important to remember to take something away from it that is valuable. Constructive criticism can be used to help one reach their goals. Not all advice will be of use, but when taken with an open heart, it can help foster optimistic mindsets and create an attitude of resilience in the face of obstacles. It is also known that positive words have a powerful impact on people. Whether it is something said in a role-model, movie quote, or from a stranger, even the slightest remark can greatly affect someone's perception of success. Little words of encouragement can act as boosters to get one back to their feet and back on track. Ultimately, what matters most is to pursure one's own dreams and find a way to make them a reality.",AI

When considering whether students should work in schools or their homes, many factors must be taken into consideration. Social interactions, academic improvement, and peer support are the main choices that need to be weighed in this decision. 

When students work in a school setting, they benefit from frequent social interactions and the varied perspectives of their classmates. They can utilize their differences to collaborate closely on projects, which can in turn lead to better academic performance. At the same time, they can build relationships with peers and have support from each other in a positive and safe environment. 

However, working from home has its own set of benefits. Students are able to work in a comfortable and distraction-free environment. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are more independent and self-motivated and need less guidance. At the same time, students can maintain contact with their peers and teachers online through video conferencing to ensure they do not miss out on the social connections while also avoiding potential problems of in-person interaction. 

Ultimately, the decision as to whether students should work in schools or their homes depends on many factors and must be made on an individual basis. Both options offer advantages, and it is important to assess a student's particular needs and their preferences before making a decision.",AI

Character traits shape a person's identity and define their path through life. They can be shaped and developed by both internal and external aspects, such as family, the environment, and society. Through developing one's traits, an individual can meet their goals. An exploration of whether something so intrinsic can be managed, or if it is partially influenced by external forces, is essential.

Take for instance the essay of a student aspiring for a scholarship. The student's determination, passion, and hard work were key elements in their efforts to fulfill their goal. While each of these aspects were shaped by the student's internal drive, their growth would not have been possible without the support of the environment. This example highlights how character traits can be an indicator of one's character and how that character develops over time. 

Character traits can never be fully controlled, since they are a part of our nature. An individual's character traits form a unique identity that shapes their path in life.

Asking for and receiving opinions from others can be a difficult endeavor, but when done with the right mindset, it can provide invaluable insight and significant benefits for finding solutions to problems or making important decisions. By listening to varying perspectives, we can open ourselves up to new ideas and ways of thinking, ultimately leading to improved outcomes. 

One of the biggest obstacles to asking for or giving opinions is fear. It can be nerve-wracking to approach people and open up to criticism, but taking a measured and prepared approach can help ease some of those worries. Start by thinking through what you want to say beforehand and practice conveying your thoughts in an organized and concise manner. This will help ensure that your opinion is thoughtful and well-received. 

Having the ability to effectively communicate is an important skill, and it goes beyond simply asking for and receiving opinions. It involves being able to identify valuable feedback and sift through information to draw meaningful conclusions.

The idea of a four-day school week has been gaining traction among many school districts recently; the idea is that by condensing the school week into four days and increasing the amount of time spent at school during those days, the amount of time each student has to complete their schoolwork is increased. However, there can be major disadvantages associated with this schedule.

The main issue with the four-day school week is the length of the school day. With two additional hours of school, student fatigue and stress build up more quickly than before. This can detract from the quality of student learning in the long run. A longer school day also has the potential to affect our students’ health; some have argued that these additional two hours of school could lead to mental and physical exhaustion, headaches, and difficulty sleeping.

In addition, this schedule does not allow for flexibility in learning; some students may have difficulty handling different areas of the curriculum. While there is potential for more in-depth learning, some students may not be able to keep up with the extended school day. Furthermore, after-school activities and extracurriculars would be more difficult to manage with a four-day school week.

Finally, it’s important to consider the practical side of the four-day school week. Bus routes need to be adjusted, and many school staff such as custodians and cafeteria workers may not have jobs available every day due to the school closures on Fridays. This presents a problem for lower income and tax-dependent schools.

A four-day school week with two additional hours of school can have many disadvantages that must be taken into consideration. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, there are potential problems that must be considered before implementing such a system.",AI

    More and more businesses are beginning to embrace the idea of a four-day workweek. By reducing the number of days worked each week to four, employees have more days off, leading to lower stress levels, increased motivation and fresh energy for the days worked. This can also have a significant impact on the environment and can help cut down on energy and resource consumption.

If applied to the education system, adopting a four-day school week model can likewise bring advantages to students, their families, and the environment. For example, students can have more flexibility in their schedules, allowing them to spend additional time on outside activities, such as music lessons, sports, hobby clubs, and community work. They can also use their three-day weekend to rest and recharge for the next week, reducing their stress levels and anxiety about homework and tests. Furthermore, the four-day school week model helps reduce energy and resource consumption. By closing the school for one day each week, energy costs go down, as well as the amount of paper, resources, and waste produced.

Families can also benefit from a four-day school week model, by having more days of freedom to get out and explore. They can save money on transportation to and from school and on extracurricular activities, as well as less food waste produced from lunches. Additionally, they will have more time to connect more often as a family.

By adopting a four-day school week model, students, their families, and the environment can yield benefits. It will help create a healthier, more successful environment for those involved while helping reduce stress, energy consumption, and resource waste.",AI

It is important to learn from our failures and keep pushing forward. Taking risks and being able to fail once in a while are essential if we want to grow as people and reach our goals. That's why it is important to always believe in ourselves and give ourselves a second chance. With a renewed perspective and the right attitude, we can turn our failures into successes.",AI

Taking classes from home can be an advantageous and time-saving experience for students during these unique times, but it does have its drawbacks. From the perspective of those who have taken online classes, the greatest benefit is the flexibility it provides. Students can do their work at anytime they choose and automatically save from having to make a trip from school to home and the other way around. This can also save time by not having to wait in between classes. 

On the other hand, a significant disadvantage can be the potential for distractions. It is much more difficult for students to stay focused and complete their work when taking classes from home since there could be various distractions such as television, family members, pets, etc. As well, if a student does not have enough motivation, taking classes online can lead to procrastination and be detrimental to learning.",AI

First impressions are often incredibly influential when forming opinions of one another. A person's looks, personality, and communication skills all play major role in how we perceive them initially. Take for example, two people you meet at a party. Person A is dressed very sharply and has excellent public speaking skills, alluding to confidence and intelligence. Person B, on the other hand, is wearing more casual clothing and is more reserved in his speech. Most people would form an initial impression of person A as professional, while person B might be seen as more casual and laid-back. However, this initial impression doesn't always tell the full story and it's possible that person B may actually be more competent over time. A person's attitude, values, and sense of humor, for example, can only be truly observed over a longer period of time. 

There are several ways to improve your first impression. When it comes to a person's physical appearance, paying attention to details such as clothing, postures, and facial expressions can go a long way in developing trust. Developing communication skills such as the ability to ask meaningful questions and make meaningful conversation can also be incredibly beneficial. Building a strong sense of presence by making eye contact and conveying confidence in one's words and body language are also essential. Finally, engaging in positive conversations with those you meet and actively listening to their ideas can help establish a positive initial impression.",AI

Graduating high school in three years instead of four could provide students with several potential benefits. On the academic front, this would likely lead to a more advanced curriculum where students can cover more material in the span of three years as opposed to four. Furthermore, students may be better prepared for college given the exposure to more challenging classes and the chance to complete appropriate coursework earlier.

This option could also benefit students’ extracurricular activities. With an accelerated timeline, students could move on to college a year earlier than their peers, freeing up time to partake in more campus activities or take on a summer internship. Furthermore, those who decide to save money by enrolling in a less expensive college for this fourth year could use this time to take more classes or get work experience.

However, graduating high school in three years could also have a negative impact on student life. Without an additional year of high school, students may miss out on some of the traditional experiences, such as playing sports or attending school dances. Additionally, those who are unsure of their post-high school plans may not have enough time to research their options or gain sufficient familiarity with the college application process.",AI

Everyone has unique passions, skills, and dreams, which can be difficult to pursue if you are not truly being yourself. It is often said that the phrase ""be yourself"" has become cliché, but in short, it is incredibly powerful. Through being true to your authentic self, oftentimes you can unlock the greatest accomplishments that you are capable of achieving. 

For example, consider Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, two of the most famous entrepreneurs of all-time. Both individuals followed their instinct and pursued what they were passionate about. Their passion turned into ambition, which allowed them to eventually revolutionize how the world views technology today. In another example, the popular country music artist Taylor Swift found her success by writing honest songs that people could relate to. By staying true to what her music was meant to represent, she ended up becoming one of the most successful musicians of all-time. 

From these examples, it is clear that the ability to be yourself can lead to great accomplishments. These examples show that by understanding your truest passions and aspirations and believing in them wholeheartedly, you can discover your own greatest accomplishments.",AI

Working in groups has a range of benefits compared to working alone. Collaborative efforts have the advantage of combining a variety of perspectives; when it comes to tackling an issue, two or more people working together can provide different perspectives than a single individual. This makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to problems. Additionally, group work has the potential to be more efficient than individual work, as dividing the workload amongst members can speed up the process. 

Communication is an important factor in group work. Having a common goal and communicating it through all group members ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing conflict and misinterpretation. It is also essential to respect each other's opinions and points of view in order to create an effective atmosphere towards achieving the goal. Additionally, groups can provide helpful and constructive feedback to its members, which can help refine ideas and identify potential weaknesses. 

From my own experience, working in groups can be incredibly advantageous. Group work has enabled me to learn from the collective knowledge of my peers, and allowed me to develop my capacity for collaboration and communication. Furthermore, I was able to use group based activities to develop proficiency in problem solving and negotiation, essential skills in the real world. 

Ultimately, working in groups has many advantages compared to working alone. It is an efficient way of working and allows people to benefit from different perspectives. Furthermore, group work can foster strong teamwork skills, communication, and problem solving skills - all of which are necessary out in the real world.  For these reasons, group work should be considered as a preferable method of working.",AI

I have personally experienced the empowerment that comes from rising to the challenge of something I have never done before. I once set a goal of running a half marathon, a goal that seemed lofty and daunting given that I was a beginner runner. In order to meet this goal, I had to commit to regular running and to gradually increase the duration and intensity of my runs. With persistence, I was able to achieve my goal and even surpass it. I discovered a huge sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from pushing myself beyond my physical and mental limitations. 

Alternatively, I witnessed the opposite situation when someone I knew set a goal that they were unable to reach. Despite their initial enthusiasm for their goal, they eventually lacked the confidence and perseverance to stay committed to the goal. They felt a sense of failure and disappointment quite keenly and I could see how this had the potential to discourage them from doing things that were outside of their comfort zone. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is highly applicable here. Although growing requires a degree of risk and vulnerability, it is those who take such risks and step outside of their comfort zones who find the greatest rewards.",AI

Online classes offer students the flexibility to learn at their own pace from the comfort of their own home or wherever else they might choose to work. They provide access to educational content from all over the world and can serve as an effective supplement to in-person classes. In some cases, they may even provide a structural advantage over traditional class settings, as students can learn at their own pace and from different teachers. 

However, online classes also present certain drawbacks. Interaction between teachers and students can often be limited, and this can make it difficult to develop a meaningful relationship or understand complex concepts. Additionally, the lack of in-person guidance can make accountability more difficult for students and make it more likely that they’ll struggle to stay organized. 

Overall, online classes offer great potential to supplement student learning but should not be viewed as a full alternative to physical classes. With a combination of interactive material and virtual classrooms, they can help to engage students and provide a unique learning experience. ",AI

I agree with Tomas Jefferson's sentiment that it is important to stay active to make the most of life. Being idle will lead to missed opportunities because it removes momentum and the opportunity for growth. For example, a student who constantly stops studying and procrastinates will miss out on having a better GPA. Alternatively, a person who remains more actively involved in work, relationships, and hobbies will be better set up for success. Similarly, a business who is constantly expanding and taking fiscal risks is more likely to succeed than the company who takes the approach of doing nothing and waiting for the market to change. In all, it is clear that the rewards gained from staying active far outweigh the costs of being idle.",AI

In recent years, Generic_School has begun offering a three-year graduation program to its students. This rapid path to graduation enables students to save time, money, and graduate earlier than if they had followed the traditional four-year graduation path. But what are the pros and cons of such a program? And how does it affect the broader student body? 

The primary advantage of the three-year graduation program is that it can enable certain students to save money, time, and graduate earlier than usual. By compressing the traditional four years into three, students can take the same courses to obtain a degree, but faster. This could be especially advantageous for students who are paying their tuition on their own, or who have already found a career path and would like to pursue it as soon as possible. 

However, this program could also have some downsides that must be considered. With less time to experiment with courses, students may end up deciding on an academic path ahead of time without the possibility of changing their mind. Additionally, the three-year program could make it harder for students to receive aid from scholarships and grants. This rapid-path to graduation may also easier for students to feel overwhelmed by the amount of coursework they need to complete in a compressed time-frame.

When it comes to its impact on the broader student body, the three-year graduation program could create a situation of inequity between those who can and cannot take advantage of the program. Additionally, it could create a situation of overcrowding in certain college courses due to the larger number of students taking the same course in one given semester. 

The three-year graduation program offered by Generic_School certainly has a number of pros and cons, and can have considerable impacts on student body. Therefore, it is important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding if this program is suitable for each individual student.",AI

Graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four could be a game changer for students. One of the greatest potential advantages of graduating one year earlier is the ability to start an exciting career path a year earlier. For students interested in a technical or professional field, being able to jump-start their education and begin working towards their dream career a year earlier can open many doors in a much shorter amount of time. 

Another potential advantage of graduating almost a year sooner is the potential for financial freedom. By finishing school early and entering the job market earlier, students have the potential to make more money each year, thus allowing them to save more and support their family sooner while leading a more comfortable financial life. This can reduce the amount of debt students need to accumulate and potentially decrease the amount of time needed to pay off any debt. 

Finally, an earlier graduation date also has the potential to give students more time to dedicate to their family. Students graduating early are able to have more free time to return to their home town and spend quality time with their family and loved ones and help build stronger emotional connections with their roots. Graduating sooner gives students the opportunity to travel home more often and strengthen those connections in a much shorter amount of time.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four can open many doors for students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom. Therefore, it is beneficial for high school students to take this opportunity and accelerate their education to be able to benefit from these potential advantages.",AI

One need not look very far to find proof of the concept that growth can only happen if one is willing to step out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging. Take, for instance, the story of John, a successful web-developer who had been working in the same position for the past five years. Despite his happiness in his job and consistent success, he felt a nagging feeling that he wanted to try something different. So he decided to take a risk and enrolled in a course in web-design, something which he had never tried before. Though the course was challenging and he had to put in a lot of extra effort, he eventually found success and was able to switch to a new career working in web-design.

The potential risk associated with trying something new is failure and disappointment. The potential reward of trying something outside of one's comfort zone is the satisfaction of having gained new knowledge and experiences, ultimately leading to greater happiness and success. The statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in life” is certainly true—at least for John.",AI

First impressions are difficult to shake, but not impossible. Everyone has had experiences where their first impression of someone has changed over time. For instance, when I first met my manager at work, I was unsure of how she would react to my ideas. She seemed distant and I was hesitant to voice my thoughts. Over time, however, I got to know her better and she opened up to me. I eventually learnt that her distant demeanor was only her way of being professional. Now, I respect her as someone who values hard work.

Another example of how my initial impression of someone had changed was when I met my best friend. At first, I thought she was too judgemental and was wary of making friends with her. However, as I got to know her better, I began to appreciate her for her honest and direct personality. Now, she is one of my closest friends.

Online classes can offer a unique learning opportunity for students with special needs, those who speak different languages, and those who have difficulty adjusting to the school environment. 

For students with special needs, enrolling in an online class can provide them with the necessary tools and individualized guidance to be successful in their educational endeavors. By removing the physical barriers of attending a traditional school, participating in an online course gives these students the confidence and independence to succeed despite any special needs.

For non-native language students, taking an online course can be a great way to deepen their understanding of a language or start from scratch. By working in an online environment, students can actively engage in language acquisition in their own pace and in a structured manner.

High school students should not be required to take music, art, and drama classes because these subjects are often seen as secondary branches of a student's educational career. It is impossible to deny the importance of these subjects—students should have the opportunity to explore their creative passions—but for many students, their primary focus is on more academic classes. Often, in order to make room for these subjects, students need to sacrifice other classes, such as math, science and language, which are essential for preparing students for college. By not requiring these creative classes, students can dedicate more time to the core subjects that are necessary for succeeding in the long term. 
 
Furthermore, the benefit of enrolling in music, art, and drama classes is largely individual. While some students may gain tremendous value from these classes, others may not find the same utility in them. This makes it difficult to justify a blanket requirement across the entire student body as it would not be a beneficial use of time for everyone. If the classes are optional, students can choose to take them if they think it suits their individual interests, and teachers are able to create classes tailored to their students' needs. 

In conclusion, music, art, and drama classes should not be required for high school students. This would ensure that students have the freedom to choose the classes that are best suited to their individual interests, and make room for the academic classes that are essential for college preparation.",AI

Working independently and in a group both have their own advantages and disadvantages. When it comes to learning, working independently often leads to more complete understanding and mastery of a certain task, since the individual is able to focus on their own learning process without the distraction of having to consider others. However, in a group setting, learning can be enhanced due to the exchange of ideas and the faster completion of tasks.

When it comes to productivity, working independently can be more efficient as there is less risk of distraction and peers getting lost on unrelated tasks. On the other hand, in group settings people can collaborate and provide each other with support that can lead to increased creativity and productivity.

In terms of communication and accuracy, working independently can lead to a more accurate and detailed work, as the individual has full control of what is being done and can give sharp attention to the specific details. On the other hand, working in a group enables team members to communicate and discuss any discrepancies, which lead to more accurate solutions.

Ultimately, I believe that while both working independently and in a group can be effective, depending on one’s goals and objectives, working in a group setting can prove to be more effective and productive. The exchange of ideas within a group setting and the collaboration that takes place can lead to a more efficient outcome. Additionally, the team members can take advantage of each other’s skills to complete tasks better and faster than they would be able to do alone.",AI

Upon graduating high school, students are often faced with many potential career paths. One of the most popular post-secondary routes is to go to college to pursue further studies in a given field of interest. This can provide job opportunities in a variety of fields, such as accounting, engineering, and law. The benefits to this include the potential for higher salary prospects, greater job security, and the experience of pursuing more specialized training. On the flip side, there is also the financial commitment and technical aptitude required to complete some of these courses.

Alternately, students can take on an apprenticeship in order to receive on-the-job training in a desired field. This pathway provides the student with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience alongside more experienced professionals and a potential salary while doing so. The potential downsides to this approach are the initially lower wages compared to those of university graduates, and some jobs in this field may be harder to secure and stability may be lower in comparison.

Deciding on a career can be a difficult and time-consuming process, and for students in high school, it presents a unique challenge. On one hand, making career decisions in high school can be beneficial for students who already have a specific interest or goal in mind. High school provides ample opportunities to explore potential career paths and test out different areas of interest. On the other hand, requiring students to pick a career right when they enter high school can be detrimental to their development. It can be stressful for students who don’t have the resources to effectively explore their options and who lack adequate information to make a meaningful decision.

Various methods can help students make career decisions without inciting too much stress. For instance, school counselors and advisors can provide guidance and advice throughout the decision-making process.

The old adage, ""If you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will grow,"" holds true in life. If we are static in our knowledge and in our experiences, we risk not developing our full potential. Taking on something that is beyond our current level of expertise stretches us and encourages us to develop better skills and learn more about the topic. It is from these out-of-the-box pursuits that we have the capability to achieve greater levels of growth. 

For example, a professional tennis player might be considered to have already mastered the game of tennis. But if this player takes on a new development challenge by trying a different type of shot or by changing his or her grip in order to improve, the growth potential is immense. Similarly, a mathematician who has already earned a degree can grow further by taking on a more challenging problem or exploring a new area of mathematics. 

Growth comes from pushing ourselves to explore our capabilities beyond what we currently know. We often become complacent when we feel we have mastered something, and this can halt our development. But when we push past our comfort zone and try something new, our ability to grow and expand our knowledge is limitless.",AI

Being independent is a way for people to be unshackled from the expectations and opinions of other people and step out from the shadows of society. Being yourself is a way for people to think for themselves and make their own decisions, free from outside influences. People who become independent by being themselves reflect their own authentic values and beliefs in their decisions, allowing them to become more confident and in control of their destiny.

The advantages of being true to yourself and remaining independent in this way can be seen in areas such as career decisions, financial decisions, and relationships. Independent individuals have the freedom to make decisions which will directly affect the life they are leading, without any external pressure from other people or society. Likewise, depending on someone else can have both positive and negative repercussions. On one hand, it can provide a strong support system of guidance and perspective, but on the other hand, it can create an environment of constraints and ‘shoulds’.

For example, Caitlyn decided to become independent by pursuing a career in web development. In doing so, she was able to explore her talent for coding, as well as her passion, while feeling in control of her own future. On the other hand, Mary was encouraged by her family to pursue a degree in Biology, but not for her own enjoyment or interests. Here, the lack of independence meant that Mary felt pressured to make a decision which wasn’t right for her, consequently leading to her dropping out of school.

In conclusion, becoming independent by being yourself can have a positive impact on personal decisions, bringing about more confidence and allowing you to make better choices which reflect your own values and beliefs. However, depending on someone else can also provide guidance and support if used correctly. Ultimately, the decision of whether to be independent or depend on someone else should be made mindfully, and not due to external pressures or expectations.",AI

There is an often-misheld belief that employees must possess experience in order to obtain a job and succeed. However, there are many cases in which individuals have been hired and have achieved success without any prior job experience. There are a few key reasons why this is the case.

First of all, having on-the-job training can often be an equally valuable asset to a potential employer as experience itself. There are a variety of digital certifications and classes available online that can help new hires to gain skills and knowledge that can be used towards the job at hand. This means that an employer may not need to worry about skills gaps that would need to be filled with a more experienced hire. 

Secondly, potential employers often look for people who have fresh perspectives that could potentially add value to their team. A potential employee may not have experience, but they can bring new insights and ideas that a more experienced hire may not have. For a company, taking a risk and hiring a novice can be a great way to foster an innovative culture that brings value.

Finally, employers may consider a potential employee who has leadership or volunteer work experience instead of job experience. This type of experience can demonstrate that the candidate is enthusiastic, willing to learn, and has the communication and teamwork skills needed to succeed with the position. 

In conclusion, although a candidate may not have any job experience, this does not mean that they cannot obtain a job or succeed. With on the job training, fresh perspectives, and alternative experience, a candidate can be just as successful as one with prior job experience.",AI

Recent studies have proposed that shorter school weeks may provide benefits to students, parents, and teachers alike. The most popular of these proposals is the four-day school week. Advantages of the four-day school week include the potential to save money on bussing, electricity, and other operational costs. Educators may also find more time to plan quality lessons and have additional days for professional development. Furthermore, students may benefit from the extra days off from school for additional extracurricular activities and for more family time. 

However, a four-day school week is also not without its drawbacks. Due to the longer school days, school times may need to be adjusted to accommodate longer hours, leading to impacts on transportation and after-school activities. Also, the switch may adversely affect poor and special-needs students who rely on regular school schedules.

One potential solution to some of the potential disadvantages of a four-day school week is implementing additional academic enrichment activities on the fifth day of the week. This additional day for learning could potentially minimize the impacts of longer school days, while opening up additional opportunities for students to enhance their skills. In addition, providing additional options for transportation and school programs can help to address potential impacts on poor and special-needs students.

Ultimately, a four-day school week has the potential to significantly impact the educational experience of students, teachers, and parents. Proponents argue that the extra days outside of school can allow for more quality learning opportunities, while detractors argue that the move would create too much disruption to their schedules. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine the implications of the switch for those involved.",AI

Extending the school day by two hours would cause a number of problems for students at Generic_School. First, many students rely on after-school activities to develop important skills, such as sports, music, theater, and other extracurriculars. With two more hours of classes and homework, these activities would have to be put by the wayside in order to have enough time to complete the necessary course work.

Second, student health and safety could be affected by the extended school day. Going to school for an additional two hours means students would not only be awake and working longer in order to stay on top of their workload, but they would also be at increased risk of exhaustion and burnout due to the lack of time for rest and recovery.

Finally, a longer school day would take away from students’ precious time spent with families and friends. Time outside of classroom boundaries is essential for students, as it allows them to relax, explore their interests, and engage in meaningful relationships.

For these reasons, Generic_School should not extend the school day by two hours.",AI

Distance learning has created an evolution in the way that students attend classes in the modern era. While it offers convenience and flexibility, it can also be rife with distractions that can affect a student's academic performance. Video games, phones, and even a lack of sleep can all take away from the effectiveness of a distance learning student's experience. These types of distractions can cause students to become disengaged, leading to missed assignments and a lower grade. Therefore, it is important for distance learners to establish routines to minimize the amount of time spent on such distractions and to ensure they get enough sleep. With adequate routines in place, they can better manage their distractions and focus on doing well academically.",AI

Working in groups or alone at school can have many benefits and drawbacks. Groups can provide collaboration and a support system for members to help each other with completing tasks. This can lead to higher grades as members can offer assistance and spot each other's mistakes. Friendships can also develop from working collaboratively. On the other hand, working alone allows for the development of independent and self-reliance skills, as well as time to really devote to mastering a particular topic or skill. However, it can be hard to find inspiration and motivation when working by oneself, and grades may suffer due to lack of peer review. Ultimately, when it comes to studying, both working in groups and working alone have advantages and disadvantages and can both lead to academic success.",AI

Some of life's biggest decisions must be made without the help of an outside source or expert opinion. Following one's instincts and ideas when making decisions can lead to both positive and negative consequences, and it is essential to develop self-reliance when making these choices. Real-life examples where following instincts have led to successful outcomes include entrepreneurs who start their own business, or a student who pursues an area of study that interests them, despite external discouragement.

Self-reliance is a key life skill which empowers individuals to make decisions without relying on outside guidance. Learning to trust one's instincts allows us to make decisions that reflect our own values and personal journey. At times, expert advice and outside counsel can be beneficial; however, it is important to remember that no one knows our own journey better than ourselves and seeking guidance from experts is not always beneficial. 

In summary, developing self-reliance is key to making decisions that reflect our own values and beliefs. While expert advice can sometimes be useful, it is also important to remember that trusting one's instincts and ideas when making decisions can often lead to successful outcomes.",AI

When it comes to seeking success, it is often assumed that the journey itself is what will ultimately determine if an individual is successful or not. Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,” conveys the idea that an individual’s enthusiasm and perseverance will be what helps them learn from failure and succeed.

The idea that failure can be an aid in the pursuit of success is one based on the notion of an individual using their failures to fuel further growth and success. No one starts out knowing how to achieve success; instead, they learn from their mistakes and use them to drive future decisions. The process of learning from failure can be a long and difficult one, but the fact that the individual is pushing past rejection and disappointment to continue to work towards success should be recognized. 

The success of an individual is not only determined by the number of successes they accumulate, but also by their willingness to try new opportunities even after failure. It is through failure that an individual can discover what works and matters, and have the determination to move forward despite not having the outcome they had initially planned for. Ultimately, these personal successes can lead to even higher achievements, and a greater chance of the individual reaching their goals. 

The truth of Churchill’s quote is that success is not always guaranteed, and failure is a natural part of the process. Rather than giving up when faced with rejections and defeats, an individual should focus on trusting the process and using every obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow. With trials and tribulations, and a belief in oneself, success can be achieved.",AI

Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the importance of experiences and taking responsibility for one's work. He believed experiences are essential for gaining knowledge and wisdom, and encouraged individuals to take ownership of their successes and failures. He argued that one should learn from their experiences and use them to become a better person. 

Emerson further believed that taking responsibility for one's job is essential. He argued that individuals should take ownership of their performance and strive to better themselves and their work. He believed that if individuals take ownership of their job and dedicate themselves to it, they will be able to achieve their goals and become successful. Furthermore, he believed being responsible towards one’s job allows individuals to create a sense of belonging and accomplishment. 

Emerson's views on experiences and being responsible towards one’s job are significant and timeless. Experiences can help individuals gain knowledge and wisdom and taking responsibility for one’s job allows them to become more confident, productive, and develop a sense of belonging within a profession. Emerson's emphasis on the importance of experiences and being responsible towards a job are important for individuals to achieve success.",AI

Schools around the world differ in how long they break for summer. In many places, the summer holidays can last anywhere from 6-10 weeks, while for the rest of the year, there are short breaks lasting around 1-3 weeks. While shorter breaks may seem more manageable for educational institutions to plan, it’s always been argued that having extended periods of summer break is important for students.

Firstly, the schoolwork that many students have to do can be overwhelming. Extended summer holidays give students a much-needed break from the pressures of school and allow them to recuperate mentally. This time helps students to relax and come back to school feeling refreshed, enabling them to tackle their studies with renewed enthusiasm.

During summer holidays, students can benefit from being exposed to new experiences, which can also encourage learnings outside the classroom and school walls. For example, summers provide a great opportunity to travel — allowing students to explore different cultures and expand their horizons. This will help them to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals.

Moreover, extended summer holidays can also allow students to pursue hobbies and interests that supplement what they learn in school. At home, students can dedicate time to reading books, working on creative projects, learning music or sports, and more. This can be done without any rush or worry, allowing students to take the time they need to work on their projects.

Overall, summer breaks allow students to take necessary time off from the academic rigor and can accelerate learning in the following year when students are able to tackle their studies with renewed motivation and perspective. Short breaks for the rest of the year provide mini breaks throughout the school year, which can be just as beneficial as longer breaks. Therefore, it is extremely useful for educational institutions to have extended periods of summer break and shorter breaks for the rest of the year.",AI

It is important to keep in mind that failure is a stepping stone on the path to success. Countless successful people have experienced setbacks and yet persevered towards their goals. It is this resilience, recognition, and acknowledgement of one’s failures that helps to instill confidence and strength. With each failure, comes the opportunity to learn, to identify what could have been done differently, and how it might be achieved in the future. 

Having small successes along the journey also helps to provide momentum. Success does not have to come in grandiose gestures in order to be counted. Acknowledging progress in small steps in the right direction can help to build more confidence to eventually reach larger successes. 

Although mistakes can seem daunting and sometimes a source of shame, it is important to remember that success is rarely achieved without failure. It is important to remember that failure should not be seen as a sign of weakness but rather an opportunity to grow and learn. It is only with this mindset that one can truly hone in on what is necessary to reach the ultimate goal.",AI

Research has shown that distance learning has both its pros and cons for student performance. On one hand, it provides convenience and flexibility, allowing students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. It also eliminates the need to commute from place to place and can provide access to courses and educational resources that are otherwise not available in traditional settings. On the other hand, distance learning has drawbacks as well. Without the benefit of direct teacher instruction, students can experience a lack of guidance and support, as well as feeling a reduction in motivation and engagement. Additionally, online classes can be more susceptible to cheating and plagiarism due to the anonymity of the environment.

Although distance learning can be beneficial for students, it should not be viewed as a replacement for more traditional forms of education. In-person instruction provides a greater sense of community, as well as increased collaboration and interaction with experienced faculty. Furthermore, traditional classrooms can offer more individualized learning options and provide access to academic and social resources that are not available in an online environment. By understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both forms of education, students can make more informed decisions about the type of learning which is best suited for their individual needs and interests.",AI

Recently, I made the mistake of not asking for help when I needed it. I was trying to tackle a problem on my own, but it was beyond my capabilities. As a result, I wasted time and energy trying to solve a complex problem with my limited skillset. 

When I eventually decided to ask for help, I was able to learn from someone who was more knowledgeable than me and get the problem resolved efficiently. The biggest takeaway from this experience is that sometimes it's okay to admit when you need help, and asking for help is no less of an accomplishment than solving the problem on your own.

I believe it's possible to benefit from mistakes. Even when we make a mistake, we can still reflect and gain valuable knowledge and insight – whether that's as a result of being more mindful of the situation or by seeking guidance from someone else. As the proverb says, failing to plan is planning to fail. It's clear that taking the time to reflect, preparing for potential problems, and regularly evaluating our progress are key components of success and growth. ",AI

Working collaboratively in groups is an essential part of life; it promotes efficiency, deepens understanding, and enhances relationships. Working in a group has several advantages compared to working alone, in terms of both productivity and understanding. 

Collaboration improvies productivity because it allows people to divide work into manageable tasks and specialize their skills. Instead of one person having to do the whole task, a group can use their collective skills and abilities to each do their part. This saves time and allows members to focus on what they're best at, which can result in better work in less time.

The communal aspect of collaboration promotes a deeper understanding of the task. Group members can bounce ideas off each other, hearing multiple perspectives and honing their understanding. This is especially true for more complex projects, as several views help to bring a clearer understanding to the topic. 

Working together also improves relationships between group members. It encourages communication, developing trust and strengthening bonds. These strong relationships foster an environment that promotes creative and effective collaboration.

In conclusion, working in a group setting has many advantages over working alone. Productivity can be increased, understanding can be deepened, and relationships can be strengthened. Collaboration should be encouraged whenever possible as it is an important and beneficial component of success.",AI

Setting  an  example  is  an  effective  way  to  influence  those  around  us.  For  example,  the  recent  phenomenon  of  “Juuling”  has  demonstrated  the  power  of  setting  an  example.  This  trend  has  swept  classrooms  and  has  made  e-cigarettes  seem  like  the  norm;  in  studies,  researchers  have  found  the  direct  correlation  between  seeing  peers  use  e-cigarettes  and  developing  the  habit  oneself.  Similarly,  popular  online  challenges  have  been  effective  at  influencing  younger  generations  and  can  be  a  powerful  form  of  setting  an  example.

Drawing from theories in evolutionary psychology, there are parallels to setting an example and how animals such as wolves act in a pack. A pack of wolves often looks to one or two members to set an example and guide them. In the same vein, setting an example can be a powerful force for cognitive growth and social change. 

Setting an example is the best method of influencing individuals. This is because individuals are more likely to assimilate into the groups and adopt behaviors seen from those in the same social setting. Examples can be very persuasive and prove that such behavior is possible. Furthermore, when those around us set examples of excellence, it often improves the quality of the entire group by pushing one another ever higher.

In conclusion, setting an example is an effective way to gain influence within modern day society. Whether it be through trends such as “Juuling” or through setting a standard of excellence, setting an example can be an impactful way to shape the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of those around us.",AI

The introduction of a new school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity has far-reaching implications, both positive and negative. On one hand, extracurricular activities can give students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop valuable skills that will benefit them in the future. On the other hand, the mandate may place additional burden on already stressed and overbooked students, ultimately leading to feelings of resentment and disengagement. In this essay, I will explore the effects of a school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity.

The primary benefit of the mandate is increased engagement and motivation among students. By making extracurricular activities mandatory, students are given the opportunity to try something new and develop a passion that could eventually form the basis of a future career. Moreover, it encourages students to form meaningful relationships with their peers, resulting in enhanced social and emotional growth. 

However, it is also important to take into account the potential drawbacks of such a requirement. Enforcing the mandate can put an additional strain on students already faced with a skyrocketing workload. This can lead to frustration and a feeling that there is simply not enough time or resources to devote to the extracurricular activity. Additionally, students may be pushed to participate in an extracurricular activity which they have no genuine interest in, ultimately leading to disinterest and disengagement. 

In conclusion, mandating extracurricular activities could potentially offer students a range of benefits. Yet, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks and to ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed.",AI

We often hear stories of famous individuals who experienced failure before they achieved success. From Michael Jordan being cut from his high school basketball team to J.K. Rowling being rejected by 12 publishers before the Harry Potter series was accepted – failure is an integral part of success. Moreover, research has shown that failure can be beneficial to our development. It allows us to learn from our mistakes, persist in the face of difficulty, gain confidence and resilience, and grow from the experience. 

Take one of my own experiences. When I first started my online business, I struggled to get it off the ground. I faced a lot of disappointment and failure, but I persisted. Eventually, my business found success, and it gave me a newfound sense of confidence. 

The moral of these stories is clear: everyone experiences failure at some point in their life, and there’s no shame in it. Even if it feels like failure initially, it can often be a much needed lesson and a stepping stone to success. So don’t give up. Keep trying and eventually you’ll get to where you want to be.",AI

Having grown up in the age of technology, I have personally experienced both the benefits and drawbacks of its use in my day-to-day life. In terms of human contact, technology has enabled us to connect with friends and family who are located far away. On the flip side, however, it has diminished face-to-face interactions since many of us spend our free time in front of our screens rather than physically engaging with each other.

When it comes to health, technology can be a source of both mental and physical benefits. For instance, apps like Headspace provide guided meditation exercises and educational resources that help improve mental health. On the other hand, there are a variety of health risks associated with technology such as frequent headaches and excessive strain on the neck and shoulders due to the lack of posture.

Technology has also revolutionized the way we learn and conduct our educational studies. It has allowed us to access vast amounts of knowledge and each other through various online platforms, such as Coursera and Skype, while offering a variety of multimedia tools to facilitate the learning process. Despite these advantages, the rampant use of technology can also promote distraction among students due to its availability and ease of access.

In terms of leisure activities, technology has been a great asset when it comes to entertainment and leisure. From streaming music or playing video games to exercising via fitness apps, technology can connect people and opens up possibilities for new creative experiences. Despite the potential it has to open new doors, it can also leave people feeling isolated when they become too dependent on technology.

Personally, I use technology on a daily basis as a part of both my work and leisure activities. I use it to search for information on the internet for my school assignments, communicate and stay connected with my friends, stream music, and play video games. 

Based on my experiences, I believe that overall, the use of technology has had a mostly positive impact on people. While it can lead to addiction and distraction in certain scenarios, used responsibly, technology can open up a world of possibilities to connect, educate, and entertain.",AI

Adding an extra hour and a half to the school day could have a drastic impact on students’ ability to complete homework and get enough sleep. Many students already feel overwhelmed with a full day of classes and after-school activities, and such a lengthy school day would only exacerbate that feeling. Furthermore, the extra hour and a half would undoubtedly cut into the amount of time students would have to spend on their homework. Between homework time, extracurriculars, and sleep, something would inevitably have to be cut from the equation and most likely it would be needed sleep. 

To ensure that students can continue to meet their academic responsibilities without sacrificing important sleep, it would be beneficial to explore different alternatives to the extra hour and a half. For instance, school boards could consider offering extra periods, or “modules,” throughout the year, outside of the traditional school day, to give students the opportunity to focus on their studies. By spreading out the extra hour and a half rather than compressing it into the regular school day, students could continue to earn credit for classes while avoiding the potential pitfalls of excessive school days.",AI

Research has shown that when teenagers do not follow curfew, the consequences can be severe. Teens who do not abide by curfews often find themselves engaging in risky and potentially dangerous behaviour such as vandalism, drinking, and drug use. Not following a curfew can also lead to poor academic performance as teens may be too tired or distracted to focus on their studies. Furthermore, teens who stay out late into the night are at an increased risk for developing mental and physical health problems due to poor sleep or irregular sleep patterns.

Implementing a curfew can help keep teens from troulbe by helping them establish healthy and realistic routines. Having a curfew can help teens prioritize important tasks and activities like completing homework and chores, as well as spending time with friends and family. In addition, enforcing a curfew can reduce the risk of teens engaging in risky or illegal behaviour, as well as protect them from hazards like accidents due to tiredness.

Overall, having a curfew is an important part of keeping teens safe. It can help enforce healthy bedtimes and routines, and reduce the risk of teens engaging in dangerous activities. Setting a curfew can also provide teens with the structure and discipline they need to lead successful lives. Furthermore, by helping to reduce the risk of illegal and unsafe activities, the city can benefit from having a curfew in place.",AI

First impressions may not always be accurate because they are based on limited information that is often incomplete or inaccurate. Our brains are hardwired to make split-second decisions about people and situations, so these first impressions can be the result of any number of factors such as socio-economic status, gender, age, or physical appearance. To counteract this, it is important to take a step back and consider these snap judgments in a larger context.

First impressions are a funny thing – they often stick with us and have a huge impact on how we perceive someone. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be wrong, and it is not possible to judge someone's character based on the few limited points of view we have of them early on. Everyone has the right for their character to be judged on its own merits and not by a few fleeting moments.

First impressions are based on a limited scope of facts and can often be heavily biased. We may think that a person is unkind based on a lack of politeness in an introduction, but it does not give us a full understanding of their true character. We may think someone intelligent based on their manner of speaking in an interview, but that does not tell us the full range of their knowledge. It is only by taking the time to get to know someone through meaningful conversations, spending quality time with them, and learning more about their background that we can gain a better understanding of who they are.

It is also important to remember that we all have the capacity to grow and change over time. Our beliefs and opinions can shift, and it is important to recognise this when judging someone. We must understand that nobody is perfect and that we all make mistakes. It is only through understanding and patience that can we learn more about an individual and their character. 

In conclusion, it is impossible to judge someone based on their first impressions. We must take the time to get to know someone properly and keep an open mind if we want to gain a full understanding of their character. Everyone deserves the right to be judged on their own merits and given a fair chance to prove themselves.",AI

The idea that problems, both good and bad, can contribute to personal growth and self-development is an insightful and often overlooked concept. On the surface, many of us tend to view problems as undesirable and something to be avoided. We try to take the paths least cluttered with obstacles — and who could blame us? After all, who wants to put themselves through the stress and anguish of tough times that come along with hard problems? Despite this understandable instinct, problems of any kind can be used to our advantage. 

Good problems are those that stretch our abilities and allow us to develop new skills. By pushing our parameters and pushing through what we may feel to be our limits, we open ourselves to a world of possibilities. These problems can lend to personal growth and self-fulfillment, and open us up to possibilities we may not have previously considered. 

Similarly, bad problems can also be used as a means of learning and growing. By actively engaging challenges and putting effort towards their solutions, we learn invaluable lessons about ourselves and the world around us. We may come to trust our own resilience, or perhaps understand our position in society a bit better. Even when the immediate outcome of solving a problem is not what we had originally hoped for, the process itself can produce insight into our strategies and approaches that can be useful in furthering our personal development. 

Both good and bad problems are vital to our journey of self-discovery. By embracing what may initially appear to be unpleasant tasks, challenges, or experiences, we can use these difficulties to our advantage. We can choose to see adversity as an opportunity to grow and become the best version of ourselves.",AI

Technology has revolutionized the way people interact and communicate with each other. On one hand, it has allowed people to connect with one another across greater distances and in new ways. With the invention of text messaging, video calls, and social networks, it is now easier than ever for people to remain in contact with those they love from wherever they may be. On the other hand, technology has also had a significant impact on the amount of physical contact that people have with each other. With so many different methods of communication available, many of which are digital, it can be easy to forgo face-to-face contact with family and friends. This lack of physical contact can have a detrimental effect on our emotional wellbeing and can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. 

In conclusion, it is clear that technology has both positive and negative effects on human contact. It has enabled us to stay connected in new and exciting ways, while at the same time leading some of us to bypass the importance of physical contact. To make the most out of modern technology, it is essential that we place a premium on physical communication as well, so that our emotional connections with others can be strengthened.",AI

One example of an inspiring individual who has used failure as a way to become successful is the entrepreneur Steve Jobs. Jobs was famously fired from Apple, the company he founded, in 1985. In 1996 he returned to Apple with a renewed sense of ambition and drive, and made the decisions which turned the company around and made it the international success it is today. Jobs himself stated that being fired from his own company forced him to push himself and think differently than before, stating ""Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me... The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

One of the biggest problems that students across America face is not enjoying the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. Many students become unenthused with the same meals, and it affects their performance in school. 

After conducting research, it is evident that there are several underlying reasons why students don't like school lunch. Firstly, the quality and the presentation of the food are often subpar; moreover, many school cafeterias lack variety and offer the same selections of meals every day, causing students to develop an aversion to the food. Additionally, the taste is often an issue, as the cafeteria food is usually not very flavorful and for many students, it is not enjoyable to eat. Furthermore, many students are concerned with the nutrition and safety of the cafeteria food.

To make the school cafeteria more appealing to students, the first step is to improve the quality of the food. The menus should be regularly reviewed and changed to make sure that there is enough variety for the students. Schools should also invest in hiring experienced chefs to provide meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Additionally, schools should focus on improving the presentation of the food, as this may make them more attractive and more appetizing to students. Further, schools should also introduce alternative options such as healthier protein bars and smoothies. Finally, parents should be actively involved in the choices being made, as their input is necessary to make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students.",AI

Staying active can be incredibly beneficial for our physical and mental health, as it helps reduce fatigue and stress while also strengthening the body. Physical benefits of staying active include reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke; improved balance, coordination, and posture; stronger bones and muscles; increased flexibility; and improved aerobic capacity. Additionally, mentally and emotionally, staying active can help reduce stress, improve cognitive function, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep. 

However, there are also drawbacks to staying active. Overexerting the body can lead to overworked muscles, joint injuries, fatigue, and exhaustion. Additionally, environmental and temperature extremes can exacerbate physical health issues. 

Inactivity, on the other hand, can also be beneficial in the right circumstances. Depending on the situation, inactivity can aid in the healing of injuries, such as sprains, strains, and fractures. Also, short periods of inactivity can help balance hormonal and metabolic systems such as improving focus during the day, or helping get a restful night’s sleep. 

Overall, staying active and inactivity both have benefits and drawbacks, and which option is better depends on the individual and their specific needs. For instance, staying active is recommended for physical health, but inactivity will be beneficial for rest and recovery. Ultimately, engaging in both physical activity and periods of rest throughout the day can lead to a healthier lifestyle overall.",AI

High school is often seen as the launching point for students to start exploring different career paths. Without access to career guides, many students feel at a loss, unsure of what they should pursue after high school or how they can best prepare for their future. Having a career guide can be especially beneficial in helping students to feel excited to come to school and get the most out of their education. Not only can a career guide help students explore and find opportunities that align with their interests and goals, but they can also provide guidance on cheaper academic alternatives to college. It is important to research how students with and without access to career guides have experienced different outcomes in their lives and explore how schools can give more students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want.

Instead, individuals should try their best to assess the gravity of the situation and proceed with a peaceful and positive approach. For problems that involve multiple parties, it may be beneficial to utilize a mix of psychological strategies such as incorporating active communication, active listening, and understanding different points of view. It is important to remember that striving for effective problem-solving often brings us closer to finding the best possible solution. Additionally, mistakes should not be seen as shameful or embarrassing, but rather, enable us to gain valuable insight and understanding. Although some problems may appear daunting, one must keep in mind that there are supportive people and resources to turn to so one is never alone when it comes to problem-solving.",AI

The development of technology and its implementation in society has revolutionized the way humans live. Beginning in the late 1800s, inventors and engineers began to introduce radical new ideas that would change the world. 

One of the most notable technological advancements was the invention of the radio in the late 19th century. Pioneered by Italian physicist and inventor Guglielmo Marconi, the invention of the radio set the stage for a new way of communication, and it changed the way people consumed information. Over time, with the help of entrepreneurs such as David Sarnoff and Frank Conrad, the radio transformed the way people consumed entertainment and began to foster a global community by way of airwaves.

In the early part of the 20th century, legendary entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla paved the way for the development of electrical power, introducing the concept to the world. This breakthrough allowed for the invention of other technologies we use today, such as computers. Furthermore, inventors such as Alan Turing and Grace Hopper worked hard to create computers and programs that could handle large amounts of data and be useful for everyday tasks. 

These advancements in technology fundamentally changed the way people live their lives. It has allowed people to access information from all over the world, form meaningful relationships, and become more productive in various areas of life. Technology has also enabled us to communicate with people from across the globe and even create artificial intelligence to help us complete jobs and tasks that would otherwise take much longer to do.

In conclusion, it is clear that the developments of technology have completely revolutionized the way humans live, and it is safe to say that it has made a lasting impact on society. Without the determination and vision of the inventors and engineers who helped create and develop these remarkable technologies, the world would not be the same place it is today.",AI

Having a positive attitude is essential for success in any aspect of life, including job searching, developing interpersonal relationships, and personal development. To better understand the importance of having a positive attitude, let me use my own story as an example. 

I was recently laid off from my job, but I refused to let it define or dampen my outlook on life. Instead, I decided to take it as an opportunity to find my true passion and use it to build the life I had always wanted. The knowledge and skills I gained from my past job proved to be advantageous. I was able to use these assets to find a job that I truly enjoyed - one that would challenge and reward me. With my new job came an entirely new set of opportunities. 

Having a positive attitude also helped me develop stronger relationships with my co-workers. By staying optimistic, I was more likely to approach each of them with an open-mind and a good sense of humour. This type of attitude helped to foster a sense of mutual trust amongst us, as well as a willingness to work together. 

Furthermore, having a positive attitude has also impacted my personal development. It has enabled me to approach each situation with an optimistic outlook. Even if times get tough, I know that I can rely on my own inner strength and resilience to get through it. Focusing on the positive and looking for the good in every situation has allowed me to learn from each experience, enabling me to constantly grow and further my personal development.

Groups can be great for getting work done faster and learning new things. Working with a group gives people the opportunity to find help and support from others, whereas working alone can often be overwhelming and difficult. One of the benefits of working with a group is that it can reduce the pressure that individuals in the group may feel, as it is easier to divide the tasks and responsibilities between the members. 

Groups can also help with grades and learning new things since people can typically learn from one another more easily in a group setting. In order for groups to maximize their productivity, teachers need to structure groups in ways that are most effective for the students. For example, teams may benefit from having a clear leader and consistent goals. Teachers can also assign certain tasks to certain individuals to ensure the team is on track and working in a collaborative way.",AI

Implementing a program in a high school that allows students to complete their course classes ahead of the regular schedule could be a great benefit to students. This program could help students prepare for college by giving them the opportunity to become familiar with the college setting and academic expectations. It could also give students more time to spend with their families and explore interests outside of school. And further, it could give students extra time to work, which could help them learn the importance of hard work and build valuable experiences, such as financial responsibility, for their futures. 

Hard work is a key factor to success, and a program like this could be a blessing in teaching students this concept. It could allow students to understand the long-term rewards of putting in the effort for short-term goals. Learning to prioritize responsibilities and balance academic and personal passions is something that can aid students throughout their lives.  With the implementation of this program, a high school could provide these valuable life lessons to their students, helping them to reach their goals and create rewarding futures.",AI

From the invention of the telegraph to the endless notifications coming from our phones, it's clear to see that technology has drastically changed the way that people interact with one another. With the advent of the internet, communication has become almost instantaneous, and Now, conversations can be held with anyone in the world with ease. Social media platforms have given us an easier way to share our thoughts, feelings, opinions, and even pictures with our networks.

However, technology can also have a more detrimental effect on social interaction. Anonymity on the Internet can make people more likely to say things they wouldn't normally say in person. On social media platforms, people are often judged by their posts and likes, and this creates a false sense of security in interactions. People can also become overly reliant on technology for interaction, leading to fewer face-to-face conversations in daily life. This can have an isolating effect, and can lead to decreased social skills and inability to connect with people in more meaningful ways.

The increasing presence of technology in our lives has both its advantages and disadvantages. Technology has certainly made it easier to stay in touch with people, but it has also made it more difficult for people to really connect with one another. It's important to take time to engage in meaningful conversations with one another, in order to understand each other better and forge lasting relationships.",AI

Distance learning is becoming a valuable option for many students. It provides students with the freedom and flexibility to learn from wherever they are, at a pace that suits them. For students who are not socially adept or have had bad experiences at school, the ability to learn without the pressure of peer judgment or the fear of stigma can be a lifeline. Not being in a physical classroom setting can help them to feel more in control of their environment, and can allow them to focus on learning without the distractions and anxieties of the typical school setting. 

Distance learning can also be beneficial for students who feel more comfortable and confident in their own space, as opposed to a classroom with other students. Students can learn from the comfort of their own home and on their own schedule, allowing them to customize their learning experience and make it unique to their needs and preferences. This can lead to greater engagement in the learning material, as the student is in a setting that is familiar to them. 

Distance learning is an invaluable tool for students, helping them to learn without the stresses of a traditional classroom setting. It has the potential to create a more comfortable and safe learning environment that can help all types of students gain the knowledge and skills they need for success.",AI

Albert Einstein's quote, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge,"" is an insightful statement. With imagination, we are able to think outside the box and explore possibilities that may not be immediately obvious. Knowledge provides us with the facts, and imagination gives us the power to use them in creative and innovative ways. Combining the two together can lead to discoveries and solutions that are otherwise unattainable.

For example, imagine a scenario in which you are trying to solve a math problem without the knowledge of basic mathematics. You may be able to use your imagination to come up with a creative solution, but without the knowledge of basic mathematics, it is unlikely that you will be able to come up with the correct answer. In this case, not having knowledge can get you in trouble.",AI

The school system is the foundation on which society bases its knowledge and understanding of the world. It is therefore important to ensure that schools have an appropriate amount of time to adequately pass on knowledge and skills to students. The importance of this issue is heightened when considering the causes and effects of global energy and resource consumption.

The benefits of allowing for more school days are obvious. The extended time gives students access to more information to better equip them with the skills they will need to tackle the challenges of the future. It also has the benefit of helping students develop their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and enabling them to explore a wider range of topics and ideas. Increased school days also means more rest for students, which can help promote better physical and mental health. On the other hand, there are also drawbacks to having too many school days. Students will find it difficult to juggle their academic commitments with their other obligations, such as social and family responsibilities. They may also become over-burdened with the amount of work that they must complete, leading to fatigue and potentially even lower grades.

Overall, there needs to be a balance between the importance of providing adequate time for school and the need to conserve energy and resources. Finding this balance can be difficult, but it is essential in order to ensure that students receive all of the benefits of learning without becoming overwhelmed. Ultimately, the key is to ensure that students are given enough time to learn while also respecting their other responsibilities.",AI

We all know how important it is to have a positive outlook on life. A positive attitude has the power to encourage us through the difficult times, to obtain better results, and to achieve our goals. Having a healthy attitude helps us to make more meaningful connections in our personal and professional lives. 

It is no surprise that having a positive attitude can help us to tackle many of life’s tricky situations, from job interviews, to managing relationships, to simply navigating through life. It gives us strength and helps us remain focused on the big picture even when faced with adversity and setbacks.

One example of having a positive attitude leading to success is Bill Samuels Jr. After initial failure from whiskey-making, he didn’t give up.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be incredibly helpful in living an easier and more fulfilled life. To illustrate this point, I'll share two true stories. 

The first story is from my own experience. When I was struggling with a mental health issue, I decided to reach out to a professional counselor for help. Through talking with the counselor, I was able to identify unhealthy patterns of thinking that were holding me back. With the help of the counselor's guidance, I was able to let go of many of these patterns and move forward with more confidence.

The second story comes from my family. Recently my father encountered a difficult financial situation. He was getting nowhere trying to solve the problem on his own. However, when my father sought advice from a financial expert, he was able to come up with an effective plan to get back on track. My father was eventually able to overcome this obstacle with the help of the financial expert's advice.

Asking multiple people for advice can be a beneficial decision-making strategy. By doing this, one can gain perspectives from a more diverse range of sources, allowing for a more balanced and informed decision. This could lead to a better choice than what might be derived from a single opinion. Furthermore, by listening to a variety of counsel, one may be exposed to new ideas and solutions to a problem, reaffirming convictions or allowing for a more personalized solution.  

This method can also provide an individual with a more in-depth understanding of the situation, as each party usually provides their personal perspective that can contextually provide more information. In addition, this individual can learn how to analyze a situation from multiple points of view, allowing this person to make more informed choices beyond the dilemma in question. 
       
Overall, seeking advice from different people can be an invaluable asset that can help someone greatly in life, both in the short-term and long-term. With a broad range of experiences and perspectives, gathering advice from multiple people is a tool with great potential to help someone make more thoughtful and sound decisions that can have a lasting and positive impact.",AI

Our understanding of the world is never static and is constantly shifting and evolving, and Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote reflects this. He argues that in a world that is constantly suggesting changes in order to fit in, being true to one's own self is an incredibly difficult, yet highly rewarding accomplishment. 

One real-life example that serves as an embodiment of Emerson's quote is Mahatma Gandhi. Despite immense pressure to conform to the oppressive colonial rule of the British, Gandhi chose to stay true to his beliefs and values, leading India to independence without any bloodshed. Even in the toughest of circumstances, Gandhi stayed true to his convictions, which is a strong reflection of Emerson's sentiment.

Another example would be the renowned scientist Marie Curie. Despite living in a society that championed men’s scientific contributions over those of women, Curie continued to follow her passion for science and influenced many modern discoveries. She was incredibly successful in her field and gained recognition in a time where women were largely underrepresented in the field of science and were actively discouraged to explore their true potential.

These examples demonstrate the strength of Emerson's quote, as both Gandhi and Curie succeeded despite the attempts of the outside world to shape and mould them into something they were not. It is through the accomplishments of these inspiring individuals, as well as countless others, that we can understand the truth of Emerson's quote: that to be yourself - despite any obstacles that may arise - is truly the greatest accomplishment.",AI

Technology has had a profound effect on almost every aspect of modern life. It has helped us to stay connected with our loved ones around the world, expand our knowledge, and make tasks easier and faster. But it has also come with its own share of drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative aspects of technology. 

On the positive side, technology has allowed us to be more productive than ever before. We are able to access vast amounts of information in a matter of seconds. We can communicate and connect with people faster and easier than ever before, allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family spread around the globe. Technology also makes it easier to automate tedious tasks, allowing us to work more efficiently. 

However, there are some possible drawbacks to technology as well. One of the biggest concerns is the distraction that technology can provide, as people become easily distracted by their devices or the various forms of media available online. It can also be an isolating force, causing people to become more disconnected from real-life interactions. Another issue is cyber security, as hackers and malicious software can put our personal information and data at risk. 

In conclusion, the development of technology has had both positive and negative impacts on our lives. Despite the possible drawbacks, technology can be used as a powerful tool to increase productivity, connectivity, and knowledge. As long as we are mindful of how we use technology, we can reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls.",AI

    The debate over whether or not smartphones are a positive or negative addition in the classroom has been going on for some time. There are arguments to be made for both sides, each with their own arguments for and against their usage in school. On one hand, cell phones offer students many advantages, such as the ability to access a vast amount of information quickly and efficiently. Additionally, using a smartphone gives students more flexibility when it comes to accessing their course materials and can also allow for increased collaboration among students. On the other hand, there are negatives associated with using a cell phone in the classroom, including distractions, increased potential for cheating or sharing answers, and a lack of focus on the lesson. 

When compared to using computers in the classroom, cell phone use offers a different set of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, using a smartphone may offer the same ability to access a large amount of information quickly and efficiently but there may be fewer distractions. Additionally, smartphones are much more affordable and accessible than computers. Unfortunately, smartphones also often have more limitations than computers on what kind of tasks can be done. 

The effects of using phones in the classroom can be wide-ranging and depend largely on how phones are used. If students are using their phones during class time for learning purposes, it can be beneficial. However, if they are using it for social purposes, such as texting or checking social media, this can lead to a decrease in focus and engagement. It can also lead to an increase in cheating or sharing information during tests or exams. 

Ultimately, while smartphones can have both positive and negative effects in the classroom, there are steps that can be taken to manage their use. Schools can implement policies that limit the types of activities that students can do on their phones, such as prohibiting social media use, or restrict their use to certain times during the day. Additionally, schools can educate students on responsible phone use and provide resources for academic support. These steps can help ensure that students are using their phones in a responsible way that will still allow them access to the resources they need to succeed.",AI

When making decisions, individuals can either rely on their own understanding and judgment or seek out guidance from those with superior expertise and experience. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

Making self-made decisions is generally quicker and requires less effort; the individual has direct control of the decision-making process. Self-made decisions may also provide an individual with a greater sense of accomplishment; the result of their choices and understanding are directly tangible. However, this approach has the potential to be more error-prone, as there is a lack of the experience and knowledge that others can provide. Additionally, individual biases can mean that it is difficult to make informed decisions with the best interests of everyone in mind. 

Seeking out advice from those with expertise and experience can be beneficial in terms of access to valuable knowledge and understanding. Furthermore, the collective wisdom of experts can provide a balance to personal biases. However, this approach can often be more time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it may be difficult to find the appropriate expert and to trust that their advice is unbiased.

It provides us with a base of facts from which we can draw conclusions and extrapolate information. Knowledge helps us make decisions and offers us a reliable foundation from which to build upon, while imagination is a tool which allows us to take what we already know and use it to create something entirely new.

An example of the differences between imagination and knowledge can be seen in the case of a scientist. Mistakenly believing that knowledge and imagination are mutually exclusive, some may think that a scientist's goal is simply to possess lots of knowledge. However, this is not the case, as a scientist's job is actually to use what they already know to come up with new ideas and solutions. In this way, imagination and knowledge are integrated and both used to further scientific research.

The importance of imagination and knowledge may be more balanced than what Albert Einstein initially implied. Knowledge serves as the foundation for creative ideas and imagination is the key that makes these ideas a reality. Together, knowledge and imagination have the ability to shape the world in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Ultimately, both imagination and knowledge are essential components for meaningful discovery and it is important to employ both in our day-to-day lives.",AI

Distance learning classes allow students to receive education from the comfort of their own home. However, there are some arguments to consider when debating whether or not such classes are an appropriate substitute for traditional schooling. The most notable drawbacks of distance learning classes are issues with distractions, homework struggles, and financial hardship. 

First, there are a higher number of potential distractions for students attending distance learning classes from home. Common distractions can include siblings, pets, television, computers, and mobile phones. These distractions can be difficult to ignore, and may lead to a lack of time spent focused on their studies. These instances of distraction and procrastination can lead to a decrease in academic performance. 

Second, homework struggles can be more present in virtual classrooms compared to traditional classrooms. This is due to students being unable to ask their teacher for help in real-time. Without the more immediate help, assignments such as homework and projects may become more difficult for students to complete. As a result, they could fall behind other students and find it more difficult to keep up with their studies. 

Finally, distance learning classes could potentially increase financial difficulties for students. With students already facing tuition and book costs, the lack of assistance provided by distance learning classes may lead to less economic support. Financial aid and scholarships would be much less beneficial to distance learning students who don’t attend an in-person class, and student loan guidelines are often inflexible. This could lead to additional stress and further strain on a student’s budget. 

In conclusion, distance learning classes are not the ideal learning environment for students, considering factors such as distractions, homework struggles, and financial issues. As such, students should carefully consider all of the drawbacks associated with distance learning classes before making the decision to attend such classes from home.",AI

Minister Winston is committed to helping his community in meaningful and lasting ways. He works with different groups to bring people of different backgrounds and interests together, offering a safe platform for collaboration and problem-solving. Working in a group provides many advantages, such as increased coordination and understanding, which helps to create more productive and cooperative ventures.

Immigrants coming to a new country often face many challenges, but can also receive many benefits. They come with new skills, fresh ideas, and a deep appreciation of different cultures. This provides an opportunity for increased cultural understanding and more vibrant communities.

Learning a new language can be difficult and overwhelming. It requires time and dedication, as well as the ability to practice and apply language skills to everyday activities. It can help to limit new vocabulary and concepts to what can be easily used in conversation, and create opportunities to practice writing, speaking, and listening. Additionally, everyday activities such as shopping, going for a walk, and listening to music can foster creative and interactive ways for language learning.

Programs and teachers play a key role in helping immigrants adjust to a new environment. They offer a variety of resources to help immigrants with language skills and cultural understanding. Experienced educators also provide mentorship, support, and guidance, which are invaluable tools in aiding a smoother transition period. Ultimately, teachers and programs help to set immigrants up for long-term success, and help to create a more diverse and involved community.",AI

Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts."" Churchill understood the importance of seeing failure not as a sign of defeat but as an opportunity to learn and grow. He viewed failure as a necessary step en route to success; without failure, there would be no progress. 

In contrast, my own view on failure is one of resilience and acceptance. I believe that failure should be embraced as an inherent part of one's journey towards success. I don't believe that failure is something that should bring shame or guilt, but rather something that should be viewed as an opportunity for growth and development. Furthermore, I believe that failure can be used to further one's learning, as we can always learn from our mistakes. Ultimately, failure should be accepted as an inevitable part of life, and the resilience to keep trying and trying again is the only true measure of success.",AI

When considering the pros and cons of deciding on a career before high school, there are a variety of factors to consider. On the one hand, deciding on a career path before high school can help students to develop a sense of direction and motivation, as they become more focused on the studies and experiences which will aid them in achieving their goals. With early career focus, they can better plan their coursework and extracurricular activities to gain the skills and credentials needed to enter the desired field. 

On the other hand, having a fixed career plan in high school can be limiting. Young adults are still developing and may discover a passion for a new field or gain a different perspective on their future path. By committing to one career choice before exploratory experiences, students might decide against a field that they eventually discover to be a perfect fit. Additionally, since career paths are constantly changing, what seems like a sensible decision at one moment in time may no longer be applicable a few years in the future. 

Overall, there are both reasonable arguments for and against deciding on career paths before high school. While there is a certain utility to early focus, there is also benefit to leaving room for exploration and change. Ultimately, the decision rests with the individual, and the best choice is likely to vary on a case-by-case basis.",AI

Playing a sport in a community park is a great way to enjoy time outdoors. It gives you the chance to get fresh air in a beautiful setting while also having fun with your friends and family. Plus, depending on the sport, it can help you keep fit and stay active.

One of the best things about playing in a park is the sense of community it creates. Taking part in a game is a great way to get to know your neighbors and neighbors from the local area. It's also a great way to meet new people, since parks often attract people from wider afield.

Attitude is a key factor in a person's success in life. A positive attitude can be cultivated from a young age in order to foster resilience and grit, both of which are essential tools towards achieving success. Those with a positive attitude are more likely to continue pushing despite setbacks or difficult circumstances; this can be particularly helpful during times of high stress or when faced with obstacles. On the other hand, those with a negative attitude may find it harder to cope with challenges that arise, ultimately leading to lower chances of success. Moreover, negative attitude keeps people from taking risks and trying new things, whereas a positive attitude encourages curiosity and action-taking which can move a person closer to their goals. 

The effects of a person's upbringing on their attitude and how this affects their success in life cannot be understated. Those who are raised in an environment of positivity, support, and love are likely to have a better outlook on life. On the contrary, those who were raised in an environment of neglect or criticism may more readily adopt negative attitudes, thinking that their efforts will not lead to anything positive. However, this can be counteracted through motivation exercises and encouraging words from supportive figures, as well as creating a positive environment for growth and achievement. 

In conclusion, attitude is an important component of success in life. Having a positive attitude can help a person face challenges and achieve their goals. Additionally, a person's upbringing can shape their attitude, making it important to build a supportive and encouraging environment for those around us.",AI

One success story that comes to mind is that of my cousin, Bethany. She has always faced hardship in her life, from struggling with a learning disability to experiencing health problems. Despite this, she has always had a positive attitude. In one of her most difficult times, she was dealing with a major health issue and was feeling very discouraged. In the face of this struggle, she decided to keep her spirits up by sharing her experiences with her friends and family online. She would write blog posts and update her social media with words of encouragement and positivity. This made her realize that, despite her struggles, she had the power to bring hope and joy to the lives of those around her.

This experience taught her (and the rest of us) the importance of having a good attitude, even during difficult times. Staying positive, even in the face of adversity, can be incredibly empowering and can generate feelings of hope and strength. It can also help to put our own challenges into perspective and can often open the door to new opportunities. Having a good attitude, even when times are tough, can bring light and harmony to our lives.",AI

There is no definitive answer to the question of whether attending classes in school or from home is the better choice. Each method of learning comes with its own advantages and drawbacks. 

Attending classes in person has the benefit of being able to socialize and network with peers in addition to the formal education. It can also be easier to understand complex concepts via direct instruction from an experienced teacher, as well as the ability to get immediate responses to any questions asked. On the other hand, school-based learning can be time consuming and costly. Additionally, it can be difficult to stay focused when learning in a classroom setting, due to the distractions of other students.

On the other hand, attending classes virtually can offer more flexibility and convenience. Students can learn at their own pace from the comfort of their own home, as well as from various locations. Furthermore, because virtual classes are more cost effective, they may also offer the chance to save money on tuition and transportation costs. On the downside, it can be more challenging to stay motivated without the in-person energy and capacity for interaction with a teacher and peers. In addition, technical issues may arise during virtual classes such as low-quality audio or video. 

In the end, the decision of whether or not to attend classes in person or virtually will depend on the individual’s preference and lifestyle. Both methods of learning come with their own benefits and drawbacks, and it is important to consider both before making a decision.",AI

The use of cell phones in classrooms has been met with both excitement and trepidation. On one hand, phones can be used to enrich the learning process — think using QR codes for extra resources, checking in with remote students, or offering self-directed learning opportunities.

It is up to the educators to decide if the pros outweigh the cons in their own contexts.",AI

After researching, I found that setting an example by your own behavior to influence other people can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Two advantages associated with setting an example are fostering a more obedient and disciplined environment, and inspiring others to strive for the goals you have achieved. One main disadvantage to setting an example is that others may see you as arrogant, creating tension and mistrust. In conclusion, setting an example has the potential to be both positive and negative, so it is important to consider both sides before engaging in this type of behavior.",AI
